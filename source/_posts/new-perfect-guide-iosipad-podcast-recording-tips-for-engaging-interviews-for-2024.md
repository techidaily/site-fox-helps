### External Microphone

## How To Record a Podcast on iPhone or iPad

You are all set and choose the best recording software. Now you will record a podcast on iPhone or an iPad. The ongoing lines will teach you from A-Z, and you'll get an extraordinary result.

### 1\. Record a Podcast in GarageBand

GarageBand is unquestionably the best program for you to use to create your podcast. But, unfortunately, there isn't a portable, user-friendly workstation that you can always have with you.

Additionally, it includes every functionality required to satisfy podcasters' demands. It's doubtful that GarageBand won't provide you with everything you need to record your complete podcast because so many podcast hosts use it frequently!

You can check out the video below if you face any bugs regarding the Recording of podcasts on iPhone or iPad by GarageBand. Because sometimes, watching is more precisely working than just reading lines.

### 2\. How To Set up GarageBand

Step1 First of all, **Setting Up** Your GarageBand Project ![setup garageband](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/record-podcast-on-iphone-ipad-10.jpg)

Step2 Startup GarageBand. If this is your first time using it, choose **"Empty Project"** from the list of available project templates.

![startup garageband](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/record-podcast-on-iphone-ipad-11.jpg)

Step3 Then, a window asks what audio track you'll be recording in the following step. Click "**Create**" after selecting **"Microphone**" and selecting the mic's input. You will receive one audio track as a result.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** you are ready to start recording if you are utilizing one microphone. But let's imagine you need to record with more than one microphone simultaneously (let's say you're the podcast presenter and you have a co-host or a guest). In that situation, you'll need to create numerous tracks and choose the appropriate input for each. Each track should be for a different external microphone that you're using.

### ● Podcast Recording in GarageBand

The project window will immediately dismiss when everything is prepared, and the **workspace's home page** will appear. Be careful to disable the metronome and count-in features at the top before beginning to record podcasts.

![podcast recording in garageband](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/record-podcast-on-iphone-ipad-12.jpg)

* To ensure you maintain your **settings** and won't modify them accidentally later, I suggest saving your settings before pressing the record button.

![saving the settings on garageband](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/record-podcast-on-iphone-ipad-13.jpg)

* You must adjust various audio track settings if you record podcasts using multiple microphones. Go to **"Track / Configure Track Header"** in the menu bar and choose **"Record Enable**." You won't need to do anything if you use one microphone to record podcasts.

![configure track header](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/record-podcast-on-iphone-ipad-14.jpg)

* Once everything is ready, choose each audio track used for recording by checking the record-enable box. That will become red when you press the record button in the menu bar, indicating that the tracks are prepared to capture your voice.

## Top Tips For Podcasting With An iPhone

There is nothing much better than recording efficiently without any bugs. You'll obviously be at the top position if you are consistent on your podcast. Now, it's time to reveal top-secret tips for Podcasting with an iPhone. Don't miss any points!

### 1\. Turn on Airplane Mode or do not disturb mode

To record a podcast, you have to focus entirely on what you are doing. In this aspect, you have to cut off entirely from the externals. That's why putting your iPhone or iPad in **"Do not disturb''** mode is essential. The **"Airplane mode**'' is also helpful in this regard.

Turning off these features will not affect any podcast steps.

### 2\. Turn off Notifications

The distraction of any notification will disturb your recording tracks, increasing your recording time and causing bugs. That's why putting your iPhone or iPad on **"Turning Off Notifications"** is the only way to get an efficient podcast.

### 3\. Mount your iPhone to keep it secure

Holding your phone while recording may cause bumps, vibrations, or knocks to be picked up by the microphone and heard in your podcast. To keep your phone steady, we advise utilizing a tripod and grip.

### 4\. Test your audio before

To determine how your audience will hear your podcast, test the audio on several speakers before recording the podcast. So, if you face any bugs, sort them out at the start so that you will get a refined podcast at the end.

### 5\. Record in a quiet place

Recording your podcast in a room with less background noise is ideal, but it should not be required. This includes noise from air conditioners, fans, music, or noisy roommates, as well as traffic or pedestrian noise.

Additionally, pick a space with few reflecting surfaces since too much reflection will give your music an unpleasant, distant, echo-like feel. Reduce these reflections using carpets, rugs, drapes, and bookshelves to improve the quality of your podcast.

## Final Words

You have it now! Recording a podcast at the start is not much difficult if you are following all the tips mentioned above and tricks.

This guide gives you every nook of information and the best-detailing equipment too. So if you are already recording a podcast and come to this article, switch these tricks and get the most effective result compared to the prior one.
