You've decided to create an animated video for your company, so let's get started. Is it still difficult to understand? Be at ease. It's simpler than you would imagine to make an animated video. In this video, we'll go through how to include animations into a Movie Maker project. The Windows Movie Maker instructions for making your own animated movie are listed below.

##### Step1Launch and Add Files in Windows Movie Maker

On your PC, launch Windows Movie Maker. Windows Movie Maker, however, has to be installed on your computer. Select "import photos" in the top right corner. By selecting the "Add movies and photographs" option under the "Home" tab in the navigation bar, you may create films by combining images, sounds, and videos.

**Note:** You have the option to upload one file at a time or many files simultaneously.

##### Step2Go to Edit Menu

If you wish to clip off a section, go to "Edit" under "Video Tools" and choose the "Split" option. Depending on where you place the cursor during the section, the software will divide it into two halves. If you want to remove certain snippets, just touch the clip to reveal the context menu and choose "Remove" or "Delete" from the keyboard.
