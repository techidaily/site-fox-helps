The arrival of the iPhone X took the year 2017 by storm. With power-packed features like 3D camera functionality, A11 Bionic processor, 5.8-inch OLED display, and the very special feature Face id where you can unlock the iPhone X by just looking at it made this device a true joy for the users. But for a while, it is being heard that the Face ID is failing whenever you try setting up, and the problem has increased post the iOS 11.2 update. What are the reasons for the failure of face id?

* It might not work if you just switched on the device or restarted it
* Since 48hours if you haven't unlocked the iPhone X
* After 6 1/2 days if you are given a 4 hours time and if you do not unlock with Face id in those 4hours, a passcode is generated once you try unlocking
* If the remote command is received by you on your iPhone X
* If your face doesn't match five times
* Once you power off or click emergency SOS by holding and pressing the volume control and side button instantaneously for 2 seconds
* If you iPhone X charge is 10% or below

#### Make sure you are Directly Facing TrueDepth

Are you sure your iPhone X is in a portrait angle? It is very important to ensure while using iPhone X that your face is directed towards the TrueDepth camera, and it's in portrait orientation. The true depth cam has the same view range as while taking selfies or while making facetime calls. Your iPhone X must be within an arm's length from your face while unlocking with face id. If you are out with your iPhone on broad daylight, make sure that the sun is not just behind you.
