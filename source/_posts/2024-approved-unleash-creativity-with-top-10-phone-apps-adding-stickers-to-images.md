### Remove The Background Of Your Photos

Backgrounds are one of the most popular things to edit on Instagram. They can make a picture look amazing, but they can also be quite dull.

If you want to add a background to your photos, there are many ways you can do this. One of the easiest ways is by using **photo editing stickers.**

You can also use apps like [Wondershare PixCut](https://pixcut.wondershare.com/personal-use.html) to remove the background of your photos, where you’ll find thousands of sticker packs that you can use to **add stickers** or backgrounds to your images.

The best way to make your photos stand out from the crowd is to remove their backgrounds. Here's how it works.
