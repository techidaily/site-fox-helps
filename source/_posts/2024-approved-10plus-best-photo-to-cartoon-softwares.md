Besides enhancing the photos you take with your Smartphone or your DSLR camera, you can use [photo editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to produce images that don’t look realistic. Cartooning a photo is one out of many options nearly all desktop-based photo editors offer, although in most cases you will have to combine several effects in order to cartoon your pictures.

However, photo to cartoon software products require some previous photo editing experience since you will have to do much more than apply an effect to a photo in order to make a photo look like a cartoon. We’ve selected some of the **best photo to cartoon software** products that can help you create stunning cartoons from your photos.

## Top 10 Photo to Cartoon Software Products for Windows & Mac

Even though you can cartoon photos with each photo to cartoon software we included in this article, which effects you will have to use depends on the software and the style of the cartoon you’re trying to create. So, let’s take a look at what these photo to cartoon software products have to offer.

### 2\. Adobe Photoshop

**Price:** $20.99 per month as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Adobe Photoshop is one of the best photo editing software ever created, which is why it is hardly surprising that it can help you to cartoon a photo. Photoshop’s rich selection of effects includes a number of effects you can use to turn a photo into a cartoon.

However, you will also have to create several layers, change blend modes, and create masks. Effects such as Sketch, Ink Outlines, or Cutout can all be used during this process, and you can also combine several effects while turning a photo into a cartoon. Needless to say, inexperienced photo editors can find this task overwhelming, because it requires a lot of patience and excellent knowledge of the software’s features.

### 3\. Paint.net

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows

PC owners in need of a simple photo editing software that can help them turn a photo into a cartoon are going to love using Paint.net. This is a simple photo editor that has more to offer than Microsoft Paint, and it is as easy to use.

In order to cartoon a photo with Paint.net, you just have to import it into the editor and then head over to the Effects menu. After you locate the Artistic sub-menu, you should pick the Ink Sketch option and then adjust the Coloring and Ink Outline options. Optionally, you can also add Noise to the photo you’re cartooning if it fits the style you’re trying to achieve. However, picking the right picture can turn out to be vital for the success of the cartoon process in Paint.net.

### 4\. iToon

**Price:** 14-day free trial, $29.95

**Compatibility:** Windows, iOS

iToon makes turning photos into cartoons look easy because everyone can cartoon their photos with this photo to cartoon software. Once you’ve installed iToon on your PC, you just have to launch it and import the photo you want to cartoon and then choose the effect you want to apply.

There are more than 50 cartoon effects to choose from and you just have to click on the one you like to apply it. Each effect can be edited so that it fits your image better, and if you don’t like how the effect matches your photo you can always hit the undo button and try another one. Click on the Apply icon to confirm the changes you’ve made and proceed to save the cartoon you created to your hard drive.

### 5\. XnSketch

**Price:** Free

So, once you open a photo you want to edit in XnSketch you should either click on Cartoon 1 or Cartoon 2 options and then proceed to adjust Hue, Saturation, Brightness, and Contrast. When done you can easily save your creations and share them on social networks, but you cannot upload photos to an account on social media directly from XnSketch.

So, in order to cartoon a photo with Pixelmator Pro you’ll have to place the photo you’re turning into a cartoon onto a blank layer and then outline the figure in the photo.

This process can be very slow, especially if the person you are outlining has long hair or wears a sweater that has a wrinkled sleeve. Once you are done with this step you can proceed to paint the figure using the Color Fill tool. It is important to be patient and go through this stage of the process slowly in order to avoid making mistakes.
