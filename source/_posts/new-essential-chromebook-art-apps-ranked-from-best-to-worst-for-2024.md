The images you produce with ArtFlow can be exported as JPEG, PNG, or PSD files. Purchasing the Pro version of the app is mandatory if you want to gain access to all of its features.

In addition, the app lets you set the Size and Opacity of all drawing tools so that you can adjust them to the drawing you’re working on.
