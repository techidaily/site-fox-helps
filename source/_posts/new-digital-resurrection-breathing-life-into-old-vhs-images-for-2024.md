##### Step 3Change the Opacity of the Effect

If you want to change the intensity of the applied effect, you can adjust its opacity. To do so, on the right side of the screen, you'll find the "Effects" tab. Further, modify the effect's "Opacity" by moving the slider. Finally, click "Export" at the top left of the screen to save your video with the applied effect.
