##### How to Blur the Watermark

You can also blur the TikTok watermarks to ensure the Instagram algorithm won't detect them. Here is how you can do that on the Filmora app:

**Step 1:** Launch the Filmora video editor on your phone after installing it from the official app store of your Android or iOS. Next, import your TikTok video by tapping on the “New Project” button.

**Step 2:** Next, slide through the tools of Filmora and select the option of “Effects.” Locate and select the blur effect that you want to use. You can choose the blur effect, such as “Blur 2” or “SquareBlur.” Afterward, save the edited TikTok video on your device and post it as a new video on Instagram Reels.
