## Cartoon Moblur

Link: <https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Fcartoon%5Fmoblur>

This is the most ideal plugin to choose when you want to add motion trail to the graphics in your video, but you want them to appear very cartoony. If you have used the motion blur effect in After Effects, Cartoon Moblur will behave in a similar function, but it is more suited to 2D, flat or minimal graphics.
