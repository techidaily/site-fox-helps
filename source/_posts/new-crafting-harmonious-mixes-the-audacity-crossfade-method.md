## Part 1\. What is Crossfade?

Crossfading process allows two sounds to segue smoothly into one another. Crossfading is an audio effect that is often used in audio engineering to merge two or more sounds in a song gradually rather than suddenly. This method is mostly used to prevent any abrupt silences between two songs, which might disturb listeners. As a result of the development of the computer-based digital audio editor, crossfading became more straightforward.

When you cross fade music, you cause one piece of audio to fade out—the sound gradually vanishes—at the precise same moment as another piece of audio fades in—the sound gradually manifests. This effect produces a seamless transition between the two songs without any abrupt pauses or quiet in between. The volume of audio in the source files is the sole restriction on the duration of the fade in a digital editor that supports crossfading between two or more files.

## Part 2\. How To Use Crossfading in Audacity

Don't be intimidated by the capabilities of this audio program. Before the first event completely vanishes into the second, the crossfade gradually transitions by overlaying the events at the transition point so that both are seen or heard at the same time. Using Audacity, it's easy to reduce some of the background noise in your audio track. You must create a noise profile to do this. We've put up a helpful guide on how to use Audacity to enhance your audio productions.

**Steps to Use Audacity Crossfade**:

Step1 Select File, Import, and Audio from the menu. You may choose one or more audio files, and Audacity will automatically import them into the current project.

![import audio into audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/import-audio-into-audacity.jpg)

Step2 Select File, followed by Recent files. The first of the 12 most recent saved or imported files will be imported if you do this.

![select import recent files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/select-import-recent-files.jpg)

Step3 Use your Selection tool to align the clips so that a crossfade will be applied between two clips on different tracks. Go to Effect > Crossfade Songs, place the cursor where you want the fade to begin, then drag it across the tracks you wish to blend.

![crossfade songs audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crossfade-songs-audacity.jpg)

Step4 Using the Time Shift Tool, place your two clips adjacent to one another in order to apply a crossfade across them on the same track. Select the area to be crossfaded using the Selection tool, and then click Effect > Crossfade Clips to combine the sounds you've chosen.

### 1\. What is crossfade between tracks?

Crossfade occurs when one piece of audio fades out just as another piece of audio begins to fade in. To fix errors, people often just highlight them and snip them out. There is now a vacuum there. The portion before the cut and the portion following it result in two separate audio files. As you drag the later audio to the left to link it like a railway part to the end of the previous audio item, you can now unite these two pieces.

### 2\. How to crossfade audio online?

You may utilize crossfade between your combined tracks and convert your audio file to the proper format with the Online Audio Combiner. You will need a free internet program that combines audio files. If you want a seamless change from one file to another, use the crossfade option. When combining sounds, it will fade in and out.

### 3\. How do I smooth audio in Audacity?

Use the Normalize effect to equalize the left and right channels of stereo recordings, set the peak amplitude of a single track, and make several tracks have the same peak amplitude. By doing this, you can be confident that your podcast or audio recording will sound great via headphones.
