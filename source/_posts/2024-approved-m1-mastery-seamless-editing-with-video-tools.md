Not too long ago, Apple came up with the M1 chip MacBook, whose processor is faster and works even more efficiently. While the M1 laptop is excellent for office use, it is even better for video editing. The video editing process is smooth due to its graphic card and faster processor.

However, the problem here is that Apple's M1 chip does not support some video editors. You may find installing a video editor on Mac M1 problematic if they lack compatibility with Apple's innovations. Don't worry because we have got you covered. With intense research, we managed to find video editing apps with incredible performance. Want to know the best part? Keep reading!
