* **Low Light Performance:** Most vloggers record videos indoor where the light is not perfect without professional [lighting equipment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6haG7lglKo). And it's not always sunny when you shoot videos outdoor.
* **Optical Image Stabilization:** As many of your activities are movements inspired so you definitely need a camera that supports Optical Image Stabilization. Shaky videos can be easily improved here.
* **Audio:** If viewers are not able to hear your voice then they will not spend much time on your creation.So, prefer to choose a camera with high performance type audio recording.
* **Flip Screen:** It makes your camera handy while maintaining stunning video quality.
