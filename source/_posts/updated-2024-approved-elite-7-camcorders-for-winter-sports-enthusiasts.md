Millions of snowboaders plan for snow fuelled fun in the white shade of winter season. Many people consider boots, warm clothing and boards as essentials for this season whereas others prefer to pick technology as their first need. It is definitely a great idea to record all those precious movements with a HD action camera and share an impressive footage with friends on social media. There are so many well priced and highly featured devices available in market that can assist in your photography. They come with weather sealing and can be comfortable attached to body during skiing.

#### What makes a good Snowboarding/skiing action camera?

1. **Waterproof and Rugged:** Generally snow covered slopes as well as skiing locations use to have extreme temperature conditions so an action camera must be capable enough to withstand those situations. Most of the advanced units are designs with rugged construction so even if you drop them during activity they will not face any damage. They must serve with shockproof and freezproof abilities so support extreme weather conditions.
2. **Ease of Use:** A good skiing or snowboard camera is desired to serve proper accessibility to all controls quickly. One must be able to operate it even while wearing gloves and voice control feature is most essential one.
3. **Size and Weight:** Lightweight is always the first choice of professionals so that it can be easily mounted on body or helmet etc. Mounting arrangements must be user friendly and it must support great image stabilization feature so that stills and videos can be captured with shake free results.
