## Part1: Why You Need to Zoom in/out

For a long time, only the photo could be zoomed in/out on iPhone. If users wanted to record a zoom video on iPhone that was not possible. But, with the coming of iPhone 7 Plus, users can zoom in/out while recording. If you want to record something that is far from you, zoom in can give you a clearer vision of the object and also let you watch using the zoom for iPhone later, which makes it highly desirable.
