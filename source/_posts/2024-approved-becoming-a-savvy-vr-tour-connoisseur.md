## How to view Virtual Reality tours

 The three steps to use Virtual Reality tours online include:

**1\. Downloading the VR app**

 There are several VR apps that you can use to set up your phone so that it can react to virtual-reality commands. Downloading the Facebook or YouTube application for VR to your phone is the easiest way to get started with using VR applications. You can also generally find the files online through Youtube links and Facebook links for download and setup on your phone.

**2\. Setting up the app**

 Once you have the app downloaded, you can set it up for use with your phone. Open up the application and set the limits and focus on your screen so that it can be a mobile VR headset. Toggling the presets and setting the buttons for navigation on your headset will make sure that you can have control and a means to click the items you see on screen. After the screen is in focus and you feel immersed within the VR headset, you can then use the preset navigation buttons to find the content you are looking for.

**3\. Enjoy your tour with VR**

 Now you can travel all over the world with VR headset, even in space, the possibilities are virtually endless.
