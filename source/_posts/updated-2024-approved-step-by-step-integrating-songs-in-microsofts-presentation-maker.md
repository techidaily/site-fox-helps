## Part 1 How to add music to PowerPoint?

Before you add music to PowerPoint, note specific points.

Your presentation size will increase by the size of the MP3 music file you add after the audio files are embedded directly into PPT.

For instance, the size of your presentation will magnify by 17MB if you add a song of 17MB to the presentation.

So, the solution is that you need to compress your file size accordingly.

##### Step2 Click the Insert tab

##### Step3 Open the Audio drop-down (in the Media group)

After the music embeds in your presentation, anyone who opens the presentation can access and play the music inside PowerPoint.
