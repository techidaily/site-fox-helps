02 [Advanced Tips to Use Zoom Like a Pro](#part2)

## Part 1\. Step by Step Guide to Help You Improve Zoom Video Quality

[Zoom Meetings](https://zoom.us/) is a top-rated tool widely used for video conferencing. As mentioned earlier, the Pandemic era was the hardest time; many changes took place. One great change was that schools, offices, and universities were being managed from home. Zoom Meetings were the most popular medium to communicate and work during this tough time.

Although the tool is very famous for its services, it has never been known for its video quality. If you want to improve the video quality and Zoom recording resolution, keep reading; this section will share various methods.

### 1\. Low Light Adjustment

As we said earlier that Zoom is known for its video conferencing but not its video quality. People don't know that the video quality could be improved from within Zoom Meetings. The number 1 way is to enable its Low Light Adjustments.

With this setting feature, your video quality remains balanced even if you don’t have enough light. By using this software optimization technique, Zoom Meetings automatically brightens your videos. Follow the steps shared below to enable this setting feature.

### Step 1: Open Video Settings Tab

To enable Low Light Adjustment, first of all, click on your Zoom profile picture and then select the 'Settings' option. From the Settings menu list, go for the option of 'Video.'
