### 6\. Split the Tone

Do you want to give your picture a vibrant look? Use the exclusive feature of “Split Tone” by VSCO Photo Editor to add two colors to the shadows and highlights of your picture. You can create a contemporary image with more vibrant shadows and highlights through this option.

### 7\. Control the Saturation

Saturation in photography means controlling the sharpness and intensity of the colors. If you have captured a faded color photo, you increase its intensity by enhancing its saturation. As a result, the human eye will automatically give attention to the color details in your picture.

### 8\. Adjust the Intensity of Filters

Filters are the best thing present in every photo editor. However, VSCO edits are different than any ordinary photo editor as it gives the option to control the intensity of your picture in each filter. Thus, you can add layers of filters to your image and adjust their intensity according to your will.

### 9\. Sharpen the Edges

Another tip to make the features, props, or background look catchier is to sharpen them through this editor. By sharpening the image, you can illustrate the picture more clearly to the audience.
