You don't need any technological expertise to produce picture slideshows or home movies with Movie Maker. By using transitions, pan and zoom, and other visual effects, you may give them a more professional appearance and feel. You've decided to create an animated video for your company, so let's get started. Is it still difficult to understand? Be at ease. It's simpler than you would imagine to make an animated video. In this video, we'll go through how to include animations into a Movie Maker project. The Windows Movie Maker instructions for making your own animated movie are listed below.

##### Step1Launch and Add Files in Windows Movie Maker

**Note:** You have the option to upload one file at a time or many files simultaneously.

##### Step2Go to Edit Menu

If you want to remove certain snippets, just touch the clip to reveal the context menu and choose "Remove" or "Delete" from the keyboard.
