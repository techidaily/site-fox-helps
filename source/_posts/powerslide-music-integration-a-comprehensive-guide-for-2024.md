## PowerSlide Music Integration: A Comprehensive Guide

"I am looking to create a compelling assignment, and I need someone who can help me promptly answer how to add music to PowerPoint.”

Adding a music piece helps the PPT be attractive and enjoyable. Any presentation needs to be understood by the audience who is wandering it. Picking the viewers' interest is the standard task for the person presenting the presentation. Thus, make the PowerPoint as creative as possible.

Without any further ado, let’s read a quick step-by-step tutorial to add music to PowerPoint as follows.

#### In this article

01 [How to add music to PowerPoint?](#Part 1)

02 [Can I play music automatically on PowerPoint](#Part 2)

03 [Get music to play throughout a PowerPoint](#Part 3)

04 [Add more songs to a PowerPoint presentation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 How to add music to PowerPoint?

Before you add music to PowerPoint, note specific points.

Your presentation size will increase by the size of the MP3 music file you add after the audio files are embedded directly into PPT.

For instance, the size of your presentation will magnify by 17MB if you add a song of 17MB to the presentation.

So, the solution is that you need to compress your file size accordingly.

![add music to ppt 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/add-music-to-ppt-1.jpg)

### Steps on how to insert music in PowerPoint presentation

##### Step1 Navigate to your Title slide (or wherever you want your music to start)

##### Step2 Click the Insert tab

##### Step3 Open the Audio drop-down (in the Media group)

##### Step4 Select Audio on My PC

##### Step5 Visit the folder on your computer

##### Step6 Select the Audio file

##### Step7 Hit the Insert tab

Consequently, the audio file gets embedded in your presentation.

![ppt audio options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/ppt-audio-options.jpg)

After the music embeds in your presentation, anyone who opens the presentation can access and play the music inside PowerPoint.

Your song will play within the Click Sequence of your presentation by default.

After inserting music into your presentation, you can then convert your entire presentation into a video and share it with your colleagues.
