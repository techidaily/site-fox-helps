## Before Choosing the Microphones for 4K Camera

 The selection process for external microphones demands buyer’s attention as they need to focus on several major details to get the right one. If you need a mic for consumer camcorders then they are equipped with a stereo jack that allows easy connection with the external mic but in case of high end camcorders you will find an XLR type jack to make connection with external mic. So before purchasing a new camera, you need to check these details so that proper connections can be developed. Chose a mic that fits to available jack.

## Types of 4K Camera Microphones

Each one of these has unique applications as professionals use them for variable video production needs. If you are thinking to invest on a new mic then you must collect few basic details about these three mic types:

#### 1. Shotgun Microphones

 The mics can be easily attached to boom pole or can make connection with camcorders. They are capable enough to pick sound from specific directions to which they are pointed.
