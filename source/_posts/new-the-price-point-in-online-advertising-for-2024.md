The users of promotional videos are companies that want to promote their products and services. They contacted content creator to offer collaboration, in exchange you need to run their video in one of your vlogs and they will pay you for that.

## What is Promotional Video?

A promotional or promo video is a short video that promotes a company’s product or service. The best promotional videos weave a story to educate, inspire, or delight prospective customers. it’s short yet educate people and influences them to take a step forward.

In both instances, you aren’t trying to sell a particular product like you are in a product video, or promoting your brand, like you would with a brand video. this is like a teaser trailer does for a movie.

Promo videos are great for attracting new visitors by building awareness online for upcoming events and promotions. If your viewers are new to your brand or channel a promo video can introduce to your channel.

Think about all the advertisements you see during the lead up to holiday weekends from big brands promoting their town promotions. or teaser trailers that perfectly capture the mood of a film and go viral, even with very little information about the actual plot.

Compared to text-based flyers, articles or posters, promotional videos allow you to tell as well as shown the product you offer in an engaging manner.

## Types of Promo Videos

When it comes to the kinds of promo videos you can create, you have a world of options.

### Product demo videos

A product demo video shows users how they will go through the process using the entire product or some of its core features. it gives your potential customers an opportunity to see your product used in everyday life, which ultimately leads to conversion. But it’s just a short video and you only put the important details.

![product demo promotion video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/product-demo-promotion-video.jpg)

### Event videos

Promoting an event on social media is a great way to gain fans and followers. An event video brings the fun of the occasion to those who couldn’t make it and is reposted by the ones who make it to your event.

### Explainer videos

It’s especially useful if you offer a product or service that isn’t immediately understood.

The explainer video is a short video that business use to quickly introduce themselves, explain what they do, and tell how they do and tell how they help solve their customer’s problems. It’s a very quick, memorable way to make an impact on your audience and help provide the viewer with the important information they need to make a decision.

### Product Review video

A product review video features a reviewer, typically an influential person in your niche, who shows the product in action and gives his unbiased opinion about it or your own creation product review video. A short but very informative video about the product pros and cons.

![product review video example](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/product-review-video-example.jpg)

### Testimonial videos

A customer testimonial video features a happy and satisfied customer who tells the story of how your product or services solved their problem and helped them achieve their business goals.

Customer testimonial videos are more in depth than written reviews. They include real-life customers that other consumers can actually see, hear and trust. Videos are high quality, scripted and edited versus a written review that may be misspelled or completely out of your control.

## How much does it cost to make a promo video

The cost of YouTube ads depends on few factors, including watch time, audience targeting, and campaign objective. on average, though, YouTube advertising costs are $0.10 to $0.30 per view or action, with an average daily budget of $10\. that means every time someone views your ad or engages with your ad, like by clicking on call-t-action, you pay around $0.10 to $0.30\. This range is quite large, but the high-end accounts for sophisticated professional equipment meant for video veterans and full production teams.

That may have been a requirement in the past. however, today you don’t need a fancy video production team that makes you wait weeks while paying thousands of dollars.

Another way of promotion is that there are company asking content creator to include a video ads on their vlogs. As to my experience, cost and fee for the promotional video, depend on what you have been discuss with the company. Sometimes the company itself offers the price, but of course that also depends on the status of you channel. The company also doesn’t want to spent on promotion if it doesn’t get any positive output or good sales.

## How long should a promotional video be?

Try to keep it under 2-minutes and make sure you’re hitting the important information and should also be true here. that said, promo videos do tend to go a little deeper than your typical video ad so take the opportunity to showcase your brand and really convey valuable information to audience.

As for video ads, advice is to stick to 15 to 20 seconds if you’re using pre-roll ads or six seconds for what are known as bumper ads, which are intended for brand awareness.

## You’re going to need video editing tools to

Things to consider during the process knowing which types of elements you want to add to your video is vital. for example, you might have to add audio to video that adds value to your promo efforts, knowing that text and subtitles are important to reaching a wider audience.

I’d recommend you to pick an online video editor software that is user friendly or easy to use software so you will not having a hard time to edit your videos. You can use a standard video editor like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to edit your promotional video.

Cut or trim your video to select the part that’s relevant.

## Conclusion

As you might already know. Promotional videos aren’t all about your products advertisement and push prospects to by them. In making promotional video should be clearly discussed and the cost or fee is always depending on the Brand owner and your rate. Also don’t forget to carefully read the contract that the company will give you to sign for the service you will do for them. When you accept this kind of work, you should always think about the welfare of your name and channel, not that you just accept it even if it is not approved to your preference, but it just only because of the money. Always remember that it’s not always money that will make you successful but the talent and honesty at work.

That’s been a quick guide on promotional videos. If you find it too hard to create your own professional looking videos to grow your business, you can always rely on professionals and or a video tutorial might help. Good luck and make it viral!
