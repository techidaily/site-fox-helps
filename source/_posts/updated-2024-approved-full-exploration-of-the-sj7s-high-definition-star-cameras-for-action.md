## Design and Usability

 A good quality camera will always give you feeling of rich quality content with solid performance. SJCAM has designed SJ7 with an impressive combination of hardware and software that ensures appealing results for all clicks. This is a lightweight camera unit with a durable housing made up of aluminium alloy. You will definitely love its matte finish and those well-curved edges add more elegance to its first appearance. The combination of satin type plastic material on front and well finished aluminium body give it very pleasant looks with light, beautiful and strong construction. And the color options are quite impressive: rose gold, silver and the lovely matte black.

![SJ7 Star Design](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sjcam-sj7-star-ports-buttons.jpg)

 On the front portion of SJ7, you will find two LED indicators that keep on displaying its activity status, one settings button for making easy adjustments for shots via the panel, power button and the well-designed camera lens that ensures 166-degree field of view. On the backside, there is a 2-inch wide high-quality LCD touch screen panel. Using this LCD panel, you can easily play with all camera settings using figure tip movements, make easy adjustments for memory card storage selection, playback, camera settings and many more. Its bright screen displays complete information with proper readability; you will find details like remaining space in MicroSD storage, status of Wi-Fi, date/time, current image quality setting, stabilization, battery status, frames per second, resolution and current shooting mode.

 You can control video start and stop functions with the button located at top of this camera and here you will also find a speaker. On the right side of the device, there are three ports: Micro HDMI, Mini USB and MicroSD slot; you can connect an external microphone to SJ7 via this USB port. The battery compartment is located at the bottom side of this camera.

 Users will definitely find it surprising to see that there is no threaded tripod hole, which is usually common in cameras. In this case, you will need a [frame or waterproof case](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to adjust your camera on a tripod. As package does not include any classic thread inside, so you can take help from added frame to get your camera connected with any GoPro accessory. SJ7 can dive up to 30M with addition protective case and its built-in Wi-Fi with added remote app control makes controls much easier.

## In the Box

 Once you receive your SJ7 package, you will find so many accessories inside including:

* Waterproof case
* Additional touchscreen cover
* USB cable
* J support
* Handlebar attachment to adjust it on bicycle.
* Helmet and stickers hooks
* Frame that helps in mounting
* Lens cleaning cloth
* Tripod adapters
* 2 SJ cam adhesives
* USB to mini USB cable
* User manual in four different languages: German, Russian, Chinese and English.

## Video Quality

 The biggest deciding factor for selection of an action camera unit is its Video quality. SJ7 Star is capable enough to record shoots at native 4K resolution.

 The color rendering option is pretty good with all natural effects so that users can make lossless adjustments for color correction during post processing. The wide color range allows this camera unit to set deep colours for every shot.

[Learn more about how to correct color in your action camera video footage](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 It can deliver high definition videos with 1080p resolution settings whereas 4K has its own impression. Content appears with crisp details having well defined outlines. It is capable enough to manage changes between different color shades and ensures optimal white balance for all light exposures. On the other side, the audio quality is also satisfactory that makes your videos more stunning with impressive content delivery. The preferred recording format is Mov or .mp4 with  codec support.

 The only thing that doesn’t provide satisfactory performance for videos in SJ7 is stabilizer, which did not support 4K mode. However, it can deliver good results in light vibration carrying shots, or for handheld modes but lowers down its performance when connected to mounts in a running field.

## Image Quality

 When it comes to stills; you can make adjustments between 3M, 5M, 8.3M, 12M, 14M and 16M resolution to avail variable results as per requirements. Its 12MP sensor results all stills in JPEG format.

![SJ7 Star Image Sample](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sj7-photo-sample.jpg)

 The touch screen provides easy access to camera shooting modes; you simply need to wipe up and you can access all camera modes with ease:

**Photo Time Lapse:** Allows impressive time lapse quality with numbers of individual shots.

**Video Time Lapse:** When you want time lapse setting for videos.

**Record:** Start capturing your videos.

**Photo Burst:** Get maximum 10 photos in series.

**Self Timer:** Can adjust time delay between shots.

**Capture:** Click single photograph.

 Once you switch to photo mode on SJ7 camera unit you will find great control for night shots and long exposure. The manual settings can lead you to easy selection of metering, EV exposure value correction and white balance.

 All the photos are capture with sharp details and colors are well distributed on frames. The fine details make post production task much easier while ensuring appreciable overall quality at all settings.

## Image Stabilization

 SJ7 is designed to offer rich content quality with its electronic image stabilization feature that handles all results smoothly during shaky shoots at high vibrations. The gyro sensor is combined with specially designed acceleration sensor so that all shakes and vibrations can be well stabilized at motion. Note that the image stabilization feature currently works only with 1080p resolution level and at 30fps and 60fps settings. It can deliver great results during handheld shoots but you will observe poor performance for extreme situations, especially when camera is mounted to capture a running field. But the fact is that this trouble is common in almost all action cameras that are designed using Ambarella Chipset.

## Battery and Storage

 SJ7 contains a 1000mAh battery inside that helps it to serve for longer time duration. Once you charge it fully, it can serve you up to 70 minutes when you are enjoying recording at 4K resolution level with 30 fps settings whereas service time gets reduced to 65 minutes when users switch to 60fps with 1080p. Note that, a dual charge safety feature is added to SJ7 battery with 2 special protection circuits so that overcharging damage can be avoided.

 SJCAM SJ7 Star supports microSD cards up to 128 GB and Class 10 (U1) is recommended. If you often record in 4K resolution, then the U3 is recommended.
