## All You Need to Know: Mastering Adobe and Beyond Storage

With your Creative Cloud account, your cloud storage can synchronize your files, folders, Creative Cloud Libraries, and assets across your connected devices. You will upload all files currently accessible inside your Creative Cloud Files folder to the Creative Cloud website at the appropriate time. Similarly, uploading a file to the Creative Cloud website's Synced files area or a mobile app will synchronize that file to the Creative Cloud Files folder on your computer's desktop.

**Adobe creative cloud storage** is the best option for remote workers who need to exchange data with co-workers. However, many cloud storage providers offer a free trial and various affordable and pricey tiers. Here is a guide on **Adobe cloud storage** and how it helps save device space.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
iDrive is another superb **Adobe storage** alternative advertised as an online backup service compared to cloud storage because its goal is to keep your information secure rather than make it accessible and shareable. Despite this, it still supports strong syncing, and some of the collaboration features that cloud storage providers provide. Like Dropbox, it employs quick block-level synchronization to continuously sync all of your files across an infinite number of devices, including network drives. Additionally, it maintains up to 30 earlier versions of each file indefinitely, letting you access older work if necessary.

**Features**

* Easily backup up a physical drive
* Encryption from end to end
* Provides different options for transferring files
* Easily sync folders
