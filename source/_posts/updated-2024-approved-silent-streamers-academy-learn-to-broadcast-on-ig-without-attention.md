## How To Watch Instagram Live Anonymously?

Instagram Live is a great way to connect with friends and followers all over the world. But what if you want to view a stream anonymously?

Unfortunately, because of the platform's characteristics, the streamer can see your account information when you enter their live streams.

However, there are a few workarounds you can use to watch Instagram live anonymously:

### Method 1: Create A Brand New Account

One way to mask your identity while watching live streams on Instagram is to create a brand new blank account.

A blank account with no followers won't draw attention to you, and the streamer or other watcher won't find out who you are!

Here's the step-by-step guide to creating a completely creating new blank on Instagram to watch live anonymously:

##### Step1 Use A Temporary Email Generator

Since the commonly used emails are limited to creating only one Instagram account, and you might not need a new account frequently, you can try creating a temporary mailbox.

To do so, visit the [**Temp Mail**](https://temp-mail.org/en/) website, and you will get a new temporary email address. Copy the address and use it to create an Instagram account for the next step.

![generating temporary email address](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/watch-instagram-live-anonymously-1.jpg)

### Method 2\. Change Your Account Name

Another way to **watch Instagram live anonymously** is to change your account info. The platform allows you to edit your username twice in 14 days. However, make sure not to use your own common element or expression habit. Otherwise, you might end up grabbing attention to your profile.

To change your Instagram account name, do the following steps in sequence:

Step1 Access your [**Instagram**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252) account on your device or visit the official website to access your account.

Step2 Now, go to your **Profile tab** from the menu ribbon at the bottom of the app's main screen and tap the **"Edit Profile"** button.

Step3 Change your Name and Username and click the **"Checkmark"** icon on the top-right side of the screen. You can also change your Bio and Profile picture to completely mask your identity while watching Instagram live streams.

### Method 3\. Watch The Live Replay

It is possible to avoid the streamer’s live stream at all and use “Live Replay” to view it anonymously. However, this can only happen if the streamer you follow has turned on the "Save Replay" feature.

The replay will only last for 24 hours, and although the streamer won't receive any notification, they will still be able to view the list of people, including you, who watched the replay.

Here's how you can watch the Instagram live replay:

**Way 1: From the Story**

Step1 Launch the [Instagram](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android&hl=en&gl=US) app and sign in to your account.

Step2 Search for the profile of your favorite **Instagram live streamer.**

Step3 Check out their story and if they’ve shared their live video link, tap the **“Play”** button. You can now watch the replay while browsing through the likes and comments.

![watching instagram live replay from story](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/watch-instagram-live-anonymously-4.jpg)

Step2 Access your favorite live **streamer's account.**

Step3 Head to their **IGTV feed**, and if they have saved their video to the feed, you can watch the live replay here.
