## Building Dynamic Photographic Ensembles

"Old is Gold" is a common saying. It indicates that it doesn’t matter for how long what you value has been around. And photography is no exception. It has been around for ages, with its physical image being the most valued aspect. Photo-montage is one mode of representing reality in the form of photographs.

It has come a long way from printed form and is now scalability in the digital space. Currently, photomontage-making tools are available for quick mounting. But you also need perfection in this noble act, which is why tips and tricks before making a photo mount are ideal. Let’s dive in below for more emphasis.

![how to make a photo montage](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/make-a-photo-montage-1.jpg)

## What is a photomontage?

Unlike the typical photograph with a single pic, a photomontage encompasses several photos collaged together. It doesn’t matter the number of photos it contains. You can also use a variety of locations to take photos. Way back, photographers composed photo montage images by cutting, gluing, and arranging pieces together. However, the advent of computers has shifted the dimension of making a photo montage. Several apps are available for not only montaging your photos, but also editing them for a splendid outcome.

## Things to pay attention to before making a PhotoMontage

Let’s check out what to consider in the quest to make a photo montage.

### i) What’s your subject?

Ask yourself what you intend to express with your photomontage. Pick a subject that’s static and simple. You should also consider the ease of adding more photos if you need to. Plan out how many photos you want to include in your montage as well.

### ii) Keep it real

Don’t exaggerate your work, but keep it real. At a glance, related collage photos will make sense. Likewise, check the photos you are importing into your editing program. It’s great to use easily editable clips.

### iii) Be adventurous

Making a photomontage need not be plain. Go out of your way and add some creativity as well. Have in mind what you want to create in advance to avoid distractions. However, add all the necessary elements and just let it be fun.

### iv) Take more than needed

Have more backup photos than you need. This gives you ways to twist your arrangement where necessary. It is also a perfect way to try several suits and find the right match for your college.

### v) Resize your photos

Photos of different sizes would do better than using the same size. So, be ready to resize some clips to make a perfect fit in each corner.

### vi) Get a quality photomontage tool

The choice of a tool is also paramount. Opt for a tool that has an intuitive user interface. Likewise, it should be able to edit your photos and add any necessary effects to make your photo montage look splendid.
