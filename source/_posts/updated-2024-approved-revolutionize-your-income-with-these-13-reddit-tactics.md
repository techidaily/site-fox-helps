## How To Avoid Getting Scammed on Reddit

There's always a chance to get scammed with money, especially on the internet. However, following three simple rules can significantly reduce your chances of this.

1. ALWAYS read the subreddit guidelines. And follow them to the point.
2. Verify the person you're doing business with. Only do business with them if they're willing to share info or their socials.
3. If it sounds WAY too good to be true, it's probably a scam. The point - be cautious.
