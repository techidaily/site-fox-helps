Now that we know how to convert SSA subtitle format to SRT format, let’s convert XML format into SRT this time.

Step1 First of all, go to the [GoTranscript Subtitle Converter](https://gotranscript.com/subtitle-converter).

After TTML, it’s time to convert STL subtitles to SRT format.

## How to Convert VOB to SRT
