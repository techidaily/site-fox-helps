### **How to Edit TikTok Video Using** [Wondershare Filmora](https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ%5FJk8a-%5F2oxfhbVB0NEFLk4u7Lj59TOtQlwLb0V2EJFBXF3zrgZwVnAaAp5oEALw%5FwcB)

**It is available on Windows and Mac.**

Wondershare Filmora is one of the most favored TikTok video editors, offering a wide range of editing features and settings to help users make the best music and funny videos possible. It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.

Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:

**Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio**

When you're prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora's desktop shortcut. The software's opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.

![mass-download-tiktok-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-14.jpg)

**Step #2: Start a New Project**

Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program's welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora's video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.

![mass-download-tiktok-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You'll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.

Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.

**Step #3: Load Your Clips**

You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums**

The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.

![mass-download-tiktok-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg)

Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the "My Project" area in the window's upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.

**Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline**

Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don't want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.

![mass-download-tiktok-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

To inspect the video clips you've added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.

**Step #6: Apply Some Effects**

You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora's many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text /Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software's preview box to add the needed text.

**Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video**

Click the Export button when you're sure there's nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you're working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.

To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You'll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.

Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.

**Step #3: Load Your Clips**

You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.

**Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums**

The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.

![mass-download-tiktok-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-17.jpg)

Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the "My Project" area in the window's upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.

**Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline**

Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don't want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.

To inspect the video clips you've added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.

**Step #6: Apply Some Effects**

You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora's many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.

To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text /Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software's preview box to add the needed text.

**Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video**

Click the Export button when you're sure there's nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you're working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.

Many TikTok video editing tools are on the market, and deciding which one to use to create a TikTok video might be difficult. A competent video editor will present you with a variety of high-quality editing capabilities that will improve the look and effectiveness of your video.

In this section, we'll go over different TikTok video editors so you can make an informed decision:

### **How to Edit TikTok Video Using** [Wondershare Filmora](https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-JyUBhCuARIsANUqQ%5FJk8a-%5F2oxfhbVB0NEFLk4u7Lj59TOtQlwLb0V2EJFBXF3zrgZwVnAaAp5oEALw%5FwcB)

**It is available on Windows and Mac.**

Wondershare Filmora is one of the most favored TikTok video editors, offering a wide range of editing features and settings to help users make the best music and funny videos possible. It allows you to edit and make beautiful clips using DSLRs, action cameras, smartphone cameras, and other video recorders.

Go along with the steps below to begin making your TikTok video with Filmora:

**Step #1: Open Filmora and Select an Aspect Ratio**

When you're prepared to get started on a new video, double-click Filmora's desktop shortcut. The software's opening screen will prompt you to start a new project or open an existing one. You can also select the aspect ratio here to save time when editing.

**Step #2: Start a New Project**

Wait for the editor to load after selecting New Project from the program's welcome screen. To fully use Fillmora's video editor, tap the Register icon and activate it.

![mass-download-tiktok-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-15.jpg)

To establish the aspect ratio for your final film output, go to the File menu and select Project Settings. You'll be able to choose between other aspect ratios, such as 16:9 or 4:3, the less popular 9:16 aspect ratio for vertically oriented films, and the 1:1 aspect ratio for square-shaped films. You can also alter the aspect ratio to meet your specific requirements.

Basically, you should use the 9:16 aspect ratio for TikTok videos.

**Step #3: Load Your Clips**

You can find the Import button in the upper left corner of the film editor; pick Import Media Files from the drop-down menu. Next, navigate to the hard drive folder containing the item you wish to change. After selecting the video, audio, or photo files, you wish to utilize in your project, click the Import option.

**Step #4: Sort Your Files into Filmora Albums**

The files you upload into Filmora will save in the Media tab, which is accessible from the Load button. When browsing for videos and images to add to the timeline, working with several files in a single project becomes substantially more stressful. Create folders and arrange your files with the My Album feature to reduce clutter and frustration.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Click the Add a New Folder icon at the bottom of the "My Project" area in the window's upper right corner. To boost your productivity and save time browsing through files, you can categorize the film numerically or in another way.

**Step #5: Arrange the Clips on the Timeline**

Since raw footage frequently contains incorrect parts that you don't want in your video, simply drag them from the Media tab and place them on the timeline if you wish to remove or edit your videos. You can send countless clips as you wish, but you can only do it one at a time, and reordering them requires dragging the files to the appropriate spot on the timeline.

![mass-download-tiktok-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-18.jpg)

To inspect the video clips you've added to the timeline, press Play or use the Spacebar. You can utilize the playhead to jump to a certain point in the movie. Place the playhead at the start of the video section you want to cut, then do the same thing on the other end.

**Step #6: Apply Some Effects**

You may now split the audio and video files, add music, make transitions between segments, or use one of Filmora's many graphic effects after removing all the useless pieces from your video clips.

![mass-download-tiktok-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/mass-download-tiktok-19.jpg)

To add opening titles, end credits, or subtitles to your video, click the Text /Credit icon. There are different text templates in the software that you can use for various purposes. Drag and drop the theme you wish to use to the right spot on the timeline, then use the software's preview box to add the needed text.

**Step #7: Export Your TikTok Video**

Click the Export button when you're sure there's nothing else you want to do with your project. Pick the format that best suits the project you're working on from the Format menu, give the video a title, and choose its location on your storage device. You can adjust the video resolution, frame rate, and encoder by selecting the Settings option.
