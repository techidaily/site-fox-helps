In this era of vlogging and voice chatting, voice-faking programs like **MorphVOX voice changer** are in high demand. This desktop program can change your live voice to match your desired online character, whether voice chatting on Skype and Discord or playing on Steam and Valorant. But if you're looking to use MorphVOX, it's paramount to know that this program comes in two packages, the Junior and Pro versions. So, what's the difference between the Junior and Pro versions?

## Part 1\. What is MorphVOX Junior voice changer?

[MorphVOX Junior](https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-free-voice-changer) is a free, open-source voice changer for Windows systems. This voice changer is optimized for online gaming or pranking your friends on video and voice chats on apps like Skype, Meet Now, Zoom, and more.

You only need to select it as your input microphone to use it. MorphVOX Junior will enable you to convert your voice into a man, woman, or Tiny Folks. You can also customize your voice with background sound effects like an alarm clock, screech, cuckoo, and more.

However, this voice changer is best suited for entertainment than serious-business voice changing. That's because it's pretty basic in terms of everything. For example, you only get three voices and four sound effects. Other than that, it's an excellent free voice changer to have on your computer.

## Part 2\. What is MorphVOX Pro voice changer?

If you're unsatisfied with MorphVOX Junior, purchase [MorphVOX Pro](https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-voice-changer) for $39.99 only. Unlike the Junior version, this voice changer is compatible with macOS and Windows systems. It's super easy to set up and is compatible with a range of desktop apps, including CS:GO, Skype, Discord, and more.

But the Junior version doesn't come close when it comes to voice-changing capabilities. MorphVOX Pro will change your voice into tens of active voices, including a man, woman, robot, demon, droid, child, and more. You can even download more voice effects directly on the software.

Meanwhile, you can beautify your voice further using the multi-band graphic equalizer. Also, this professional voice changer boasts effective noise reduction and voice comparison capabilities. Voice parsing detection and stereo microphone are also supported. And yes, you can record the morphed voice and morph local sound files. All in all, this voice changer is worth every penny.

## Part 3\. How to use MorphVOX voice changer?

Up to this point, you must be eager to use the MorphVOX Junior and see if it's worth a try. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use MorphVOX Junior to change voices on Discord. For those who don't know, Discord is an instant messaging and VoIP app where users can share voice calls, video calls, media, and text messages. Although it's compatible with Linux, Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, we'll learn how to use it on Windows PC. Now follow me!

Step1 Assuming you already have a Discord account, head straight to Screamingbee.com and install MorphVOX Junior.

Step1 Go to Screamingbee.com and install MorphVOX Pro for macOS. This program runs on Mac OS X 10.6 or newer. After installing, complete the purchase by requesting a product key.

Just tap the **Download** button to download the voice pack.
