### No.3 Terabox

Most cloud storage services only provide a small amount of free storage; if you need more space, you must purchase a premium subscription.

The advertising and the restricted upload size are drawbacks of the free Terabox plan, but you can overcome these with the paid plan option.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)
