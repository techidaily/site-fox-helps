Color Finale 2.0"></a>3. Color Finale 2.0</h3><p>Most people using final cut pro X were somewhat unsatisfied with the internally practical fast color correction tools. It was always about having something that properly allowed video color grading workflow. That is when color finale 2.0, a newer version of the initially released color finale, is known to come in handy. It is a new and more improved version of the previous one, which is optimized for having metal and more color management features such as ACES.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/color-finale-2-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="color finale 2 plug in"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037474/7443" target="_top" id="2037474">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037474" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037474/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>From the beginning, the color finale was designed as a plug-in for the final cut pro-X.

NewBlueFX"></a>4. NewBlueFX</h3><p>Suppose you are looking for a compatible video editing program like adobe after effects, premiere pro, and some other software like it. Then, a new blue FX that provides an alternative to critical aspects like framing, masking, and offering necessary plug-ins to improve the videos and eliminate other challenges could be the choice for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/new-blue-fx-plug-in.jpg"                      alt="new blue fx plug in"                ></p><p>There are many plug-ins offered in New blue fx, and each has features that push forward for its improvement every day.

Then, the movie could be the perfect plug-in, ideally serving this kind of situation.

By making use of the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you will be able to add a lot of creative touches to your video. In today’s post we are about to discuss how to do the perfect color correction on GoPro Studio and how to edit the footage captured on your action camera.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Color Grading and Correction in Final Cut Pro &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Color-Correction-in-GoPro-Studio"><a href="#Color-Correction-in-GoPro-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Color Correction in GoPro Studio"></a>Color Correction in GoPro Studio</h2><p> One of the easiest and most convenient ways of making the most out of your action camera is to use the <a class="link"   href="https://gopro.com/support/articles/how-to-use-protune" >“Protune” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> setting. The Protune among other things is capable of enhancing the dynamic recording range. The enhanced dynamic range would offer you a flat log like image which appears more vigorous while during color grading.</p><p> No matter whether you are recording with Protune turned on or off, you will be required to adjust the colors during the time of the edit. Color Correction in GoPro Studio is simple and intuitive.</p><p> Just follow the steps below:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first thing you have to do is setting the cam to the Protune shooting mode. Now just import and get your Protune footage converted.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Split the Image- On the right of the screen there is a split button. You need to shift the point almost halfway. Doing this would split the window in ½ though you will not be able to see that. When the color profile of the image is changed the right side is going to change without affecting the left side. This would allow you to compare the image as it was before and after correcting the color. In order to view the original image or the edited one you have to draw the pointer to the right or left.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-gopro-studio-0.jpg"                      alt="Color correction in GoPro Studio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Color Correction- On the right hand side of your window the color correction can be done just by hitting on the arrow beside the White Balance button and the Image button. Now you can see the options which needed to be changed in order to correct the color. You will be able to view all the options like temperature, exposure, sharpness, contrast, tint and saturation. You can also choose to apply different preset overlays to give the footage a special filter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/color-correction-in-gopro-studio-1.jpg"                      alt="how to do color correction in GoPro Studio"                ></p><p> The GoPro Studio is very user friendly and effective video editing software but in order to use it you need to convert the format of your video before you start to edit. There aren’t many options especially when you require enhanced controls on the GoPro recordings. This is why we would recommend you to use the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> editing software.

It is a video-sharing platform where people share videos doing different activities. Due to the rise of cyberbullying, racism, and other harmful activities, concerns have been raised for minors using TikTok. In a bid to counter it, TikTok has banned kids under 13 from using the app.</p><p>The accounts of teens from 13 to 16 have been made private to minimize the negative effects. If you, by mistake, have entered the wrong birthdate when setting up your account, you can learn <strong>how to change your age on TikTok</strong> from this article.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-1.jpg"                      alt="change age on tiktok featured image"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Change-Your-Age-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Change-Your-Age-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Change Your Age on TikTok"></a>Part 1: How to Change Your Age on TikTok</h2><p>The 13-year age restriction on TikTok is not only to protect minors from the harmful side of the internet. It is to comply with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) in the United States. To ensure that users don’t cheat with age-requirement, TikTok has removed the option to edit the birthdate from the app.</p><p>It has also made all the accounts of those under 16 privates. If your account has been age-restricted by mistake, below are two possible methods on <strong>how</strong> <strong>to edit age on TikTok</strong>.</p><h3 id="Way-1-Contact-TikTok-Support-Team-to-Change-Your-Age-Recommended"><a href="#Way-1-Contact-TikTok-Support-Team-to-Change-Your-Age-Recommended" class="headerlink" title="Way 1: Contact TikTok Support Team to Change Your Age (Recommended)"></a>Way 1: Contact TikTok Support Team to Change Your Age (Recommended)</h3><p>Since TikTok has removed the feature to edit your birthdate from its app, you will need to contact their support team to change your age. You can contact support through the app if your account is still working. Otherwise, you will need to contact them through email. Below are the steps to contact support for changing your age through the TikTok app on your smartphone:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your TikTok app and tap on “Profile” from the bottom right corner. Next, touch on “Three Lines” from the top right corner of the profile screen and access “Settings and Privacy.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-2.jpg"                      alt="select settings and privacy"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886019/19272" target="_top" id="1886019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886019/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now navigate to the “Support &amp; About” section and tap “Report a Problem.” Press “Account and Profile” on the next screen and tap “Editing Profile.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-3.jpg"                      alt="select report a problem option"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137225/26400" target="_top" id="2137225">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137225" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137225/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Here, choose “Other,” and on the next window, press “Need More Help?” It will open a feedback form where you can mention your problem and request the support team to solve it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/how-to-change-age-on-tiktok-4.jpg"                      alt="tap on need more help"                ></p><h3 id="Way-2-Create-a-New-TikTok-Account-to-Change-Your-Age-Not-Recommended"><a href="#Way-2-Create-a-New-TikTok-Account-to-Change-Your-Age-Not-Recommended" class="headerlink" title="Way 2: Create a New TikTok Account to Change Your Age (Not-Recommended)"></a>Way 2: Create a New TikTok Account to Change Your Age (Not-Recommended)</h3><p>If your TikTok account has been placed under age restriction, you can create a new TikTok account with the correct age. However, it is not the recommended method, as you will lose all of your old account data and followers.</p><p>If you are underage, you should not try to create a new account with a false age. Lying about your age can result in legal difficulties for you if caught.

Various image attributes such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point can be enhanced whether it is movies, videos, or still images.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-grading"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color grading?"></a>Part 1. What is color grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the process of stylizing the color scheme of your footage by “painting” over what you’ve created using color correction. After the colorist completes the color correction, they can begin the process of grading the footage. During color grading, colorists use editing software to stylize the shot – emphasizing the visual tone and atmosphere of the film and making it look more cinematic.</p><p>Color sorting can be used for both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color gradation for artistic purposes to ensure that a film’s carefully selected color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion. For example, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/"><em>American Beauty (1999)</em></a> uses redder in dramatic moments to represent passion, anger, and power, whereas <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310/"><em>Maleficent (2014)</em></a> uses green to represent danger, corruption, and darkness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-tutorial-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading tutorial"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial"></a>Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132161/7443" target="_top" id="2132161">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132161" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132161/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021"><a href="#1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="1.

You will find everything well labelled on screen and text as well as icon allows precise view. The sad part is the users cannot enjoy high end calibrations on this monitor as here you can make adjustments only for few basic settings including RGB values, sharpness, contrast and brightness. People rate its settings menu to be precise and user friendly with higher simplicity. There are limited options on menu but they offer access to all useful properties.</p><h4 id="2-Color-Performance"><a href="#2-Color-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2. Color Performance"></a>2. Color Performance</h4><p> The color accuracy for Dell P2715Q is quite high and it ensures classic response for video and images. All details on screen are presented with very strong and rich color distribution on 3480x2160 pixel rating. It adjusts around 163 pixels&#x2F; inch on its 27 inch screen so that viewing experience can be enhanced with crisp details. The color gamut for sRGB spectrum provides 100% accuracy but in case of Adobe RGB it is limited to 79% only. You will be glad to know that Dell P2715Q can maintain very decent performance for contrast ratio that varies somewhere around 690:1 when brightness level is maximum whereas it falls to 650:1 range for half of the full brightness setting. This UHD monitor is rated high for its response for color information because most of the cheaper 4K screens can ensure accuracy only around 70 or 75 percent.</p><h4 id="3-Calibration-Capacity"><a href="#3-Calibration-Capacity" class="headerlink" title="3. Calibration Capacity"></a>3. Calibration Capacity</h4><p> As already discussed, the out of box performance for this monitor is limited to 100% sRGB accuracy and only 79% Adobe RGB rating with contrast ratio variation between 690 to 650:1. But when calibration is completed then it can show little improvement over performance. The color response gets improved up to 80% with Adobe RGB value and the maximum contrast ratio varied up to 720:1. But it does not show any improvement for lower range of contrast that still sits at 650:1. If we talk about brightness then it was observed to be 332lux. The best part is that this panel possess semi glossy coating so that it can deliver consistent performance in all environmental conditions. Users can easily access the calibration settings to switch between default and customized settings.</p><h4 id="4-Gaming-Performance"><a href="#4-Gaming-Performance" class="headerlink" title="4.Gaming Performance"></a>4.Gaming Performance</h4><p> The gaming capabilities of Dell P2715Q were tested with GTX 980 GPU and it lead to impressive performance. This monitor delivered incredible picture quality but when it is used to play action games that required fast frame rendering then the fps rating was not able to follow the game card response.

You might have observed the outstanding service offers by HP models where users can easily control all applications on their device with simple drag, point and swipe like motions on screen surface; as well as you can us mouse and keyboard. Most of the systems these days are designed with capacitive touch system that offers great conductivity for every touch of human finger.

You can buy this device in two configurations: 24 inch and classic 27 inch. Generally the 10 series unique “Pascal” graphic chips offer great gaming experience but when we talk about True gaming AIOs then users can expect classic touch screen response for their gaming needs. Buyers are advised to avoid spending on last generation Maxwell unless it sellers offer you great discount.</p><ol><li><strong>Optical Drives &amp; Audio:</strong></li></ol><p> Most of the advanced models of multimedia devices do not have optical drive support; you will find very rare models that allow Blu-ray Discs and DVD playback with built in tray drive. But today you need to use a USB type CD&#x2F;DVD drive to gain control over optical discs. Most of the manufacturers these days offer AIO systems for impressive sound quality but it is good to test one before you buy.</p><ol><li><strong>Core Connectivity:</strong></li></ol><p> When to go to buy a consumer PC then it is good to check for inbuilt WI-FI support with 802.11ac standard.

Commonly, most of the consumer systems come with full HD display capability or offer 1080p resolution level. Those who have already worked with HP 150 must be aware about how tiring its vertical display appears when you have to lift your hand again and again to initiate touch controls. When you need to use your device for long hours then it is always better to have a little tilted back screen so that the shallower angle can serve you with better and comfortable controls.

The file size is unknown until you have the completed produced video. The terms 20MB and 20Mb are not interchangeable.</p><p>The problem is that a 30-second iPhone recording might easily exceed 100MB in size. 1024 MB or less than 20 minutes. What is the length of a video that is 25 megabytes?</p><p>At 30 frames per second, a raw HD video will require 5MBx30 150MB of storage space. Does anyone know how many MB a 30-second VGA video at 30 frames per second would take up on a memory stick?</p><p> For the raw footage, we’ll need roughly 540GB per hour.</p><p>Bits per second (bps) is the unit of measurement for network transmissions. Even if you have a premium Nitro account, you cannot upload long videos larger than 20MB. - 1080p video size: 258 MB</p><p>As a result, 20MBps is 160Mbps. 1024 bytes per kilobyte. I’d have to look into what kind of file that is.</p><p>How long does a 25MB video last? Each uncompressed frame is approximately 5MB in size.</p><p>Once you have the file size, all you have to do is guess how many times it will be seen. The video file size formula can now be used to address how to compute video file size. TVs that stream video.</p><p>A DVD with excellent quality content holds 47 gigabytes, or little more than 2. I’m using a laptop as a projector, but I also need it to connect to a second TV. 8 Mbps Youtube HD 1080p25</p><p>30 frames per second vs 15 fps. Depending on the aforementioned, a 30-second video could be anywhere from 1 to 30 megabytes. The 400 MB video file will download in less than 11 minutes over a. - 25 Mb seconds.</p><p>If the video is only 2 or 3 minutes long, you should be able to compress the file size significantly. That means one frame in a 4K video file with an 8-bit Bit Depth is 84375 MB in size. Alternatively, 20Mbps is 25MBps.</p><p>That is 20 megabits per second. As a result, many people worry if they can transfer large films through Discord without Nitro. The LG smart television turns on for a few seconds before turning off.</p><p>Many of our storage drives are incapable of writing to disk at that speed. Seconds of 20MB video When I try to edit my video in a video editor, it claims that the resolution is not supported. As a result, 1 minute 60 seconds.</p><p>So 70778880 bits &#x3D; 84375 MB (8 x 1024 × 1024 MB).

I make 30 seconds 320 x 240 videos that are roughly 12 MB in size.</p><p><strong>How to create a longer video in a 20Mb video (introduce Filmora to change video bitrate or resolution to create a longer video)</strong></p><p>When exporting video, you may have come across the term “bitrate” on occasion. Then you’re probably wondering what bitrate is. Is it related to the quality of my video? Don’t be concerned. Many readers, including yourself, have similar reservations.</p><p>We will explain what video bitrate is and how video bitrate and quality are related in this article. Finally, we’ll show you how to alter the video bitrate as a bonus and have a longer video. Continue to read!</p><p><strong>What is the bitrate of the video?</strong></p><p>The entire amount of video data transferred in a given period is known as the video bitrate. To put it another way, each video file has its own set of data that must be sent in order to play it on multiple devices. Video bitrate is the pace at which this data is conveyed over a certain time interval. Video bitrate is usually expressed in bits per second (bps). It’s also important to remember that videos with a higher bitrate typically have a greater file size.</p><p><strong>Does higher video bitrate mean better video quality?</strong></p><p>When looking at the same video with the same resolution, a greater bitrate will accommodate higher image quality in the video output. Bitrates are projected to increase when the resolution is increased and more data is handled.</p><p>As a result, while a high video bitrate can give amazing quality, it can also put a lot of load on your hardware, causing stutters.</p><p><strong>How to change the bitrate of a video in Filmora</strong></p><p>Filmora can be used to change the bitrate of video files.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Transforming-Your-Shots-with-Ease-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Transforming-Your-Shots-with-Ease-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Transforming Your Shots with Ease in Photoshop"></a>Transforming Your Shots with Ease in Photoshop</h2><p>In this Photoshop tutorial, we’re going to carve an image using four simple steps. Curving an image can be a great way to add some extra visual interest and dimension, and it’s a technique that can be used with a wide range of images. So, let’s get started!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/curve-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="curve image photoshop"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop"></a>Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop</h2><h5 id="Step1Create-a-New-Document"><a href="#Step1Create-a-New-Document" class="headerlink" title="Step1Create a New Document"></a>Step1Create a New Document</h5><p>To keep things simple, let’s start with a white canvas. Let’s open a new document now by going to File in the menu bar and tapping New. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+N or Command+N on your keyboard to generate a new document. Choose a size and orientation that is appropriate for your image.</p><h5 id="Step2Place-the-Image"><a href="#Step2Place-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step2Place the Image"></a>Step2Place the Image</h5><p>After creating the new document, open the image that you want to curve. You may do so by going to File &gt; Open in the menu bar or pressing Ctrl+O or Command+O on your keyboard. Once the image is open, go to Edit in the menu bar and select Place Embedded from the drop-down menu that appears. Select your image and click Place. The image will be placed on the canvas. If the document’s size does not match that of the image, you will see a transformation box surrounding the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/place-image-in-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="place image in photoshop"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Warp-the-Image"><a href="#Step3Warp-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step3Warp the Image"></a>Step3Warp the Image</h5><p>Now we’ll curve the image using the Warp Tool. Select the Warp Tool by clicking and holding on the Transform Tool in the toolbar. The Warp Tool is located at the bottom of the Transform Tool’s fly-out menu. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+T or Command+T on your keyboard to open the Transform Tool’s fly-out menu and then select the Warp Tool from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/wrap-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="wrap image photoshop"                ></p><p>With the Warp Tool selected, hover your cursor over the image. You’ll see a grid appear over the image. Click and drag one of the middle nodes in the horizontal direction to begin curving the image. As you drag, you’ll see the image curve along with your cursor. If you want to increase or decrease the amount of curvature, simply press and hold the Shift key while dragging the node.</p><p>Play around with the settings in the options bar. There are quite a few different looks you can achieve just by adjusting these.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/change-image-height-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="change image height photoshop"                ></p><p>20% <strong>Horizontal Distortion</strong> makes one side of the image appear larger than the other. This is what my photo looks like at 20%.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/change-horizontal-distortion-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="change horizontal distortion photoshop"                ></p><p><strong>Vertical Distortion</strong> makes the image look as if it’s leaning backward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/verticle-distortion-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="verticle distortion image photoshop"                ></p><p>The <strong>Bend Direction</strong> option rotates the angle of the bend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/bend-direction-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="bend direction image photoshop"                ></p><p>Flip any of these effects in the opposite direction by placing a negative sign in front of the percentage. Here’s -20% in the <strong>Bend</strong> box with a vertical bend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/flip-effect-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="flip effect image photoshop"                ></p><h5 id="Step4Save-the-Image"><a href="#Step4Save-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step4Save the Image"></a>Step4Save the Image</h5><p>Once you’re happy with the way your image looks, go to File &gt; Save As in the menu bar or press Ctrl+Shift+S or Command+Shift+S on your keyboard. Choose a file format and location to save your image and click Save. And that’s it! You’ve successfully curved</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/save-curve-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="save curve image photoshop"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/352557/5172" target="_top" id="352557">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-352557" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/352557/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We hope this post has helped you learn how to curve an image in Photoshop.

Letv&#x2F;LeEco Super Helmet 3D VR Head-Mounted Glasses</strong></p><p> It is considered as one of the leading product coming out of the Chinese market. This company has recently released one of their astonishing product called as Super Helmet. This product is capable of holding a 5.5-inch device on its sharp liquid crystal plane. It gives a resolution of about 2560x1440 and also a horizontal view of 70 degrees. This device also offers the user to adjust the lens, which is very helpful for the people who are shortsighted.</p><p><strong>2. DeePoon M2</strong></p><p> DeePoon M2 provides so much in one device, that’s why it is referred to as all in one device. This is not only a headphone or the PC-tethered headset, other than that it also provides services of a powerful headset and everything that a customer needs for its basic virtual reality experience. It provides most of the features but still you don’t get some of the features like motion tracking you get on PC-based system. DeePoon is a Chinese VR producer company that bids a full collection of VR products, extending from VR googles that connect to phones to all-in-one VR phones with in-built motherboards as well as displays.</p><p><strong>3. Antvr Kit</strong></p><p> It is actually a Lenovo made VR headset, and it is one of the earlier products in the field of virtual reality. It is also one of the most recommended products present in the company. The founder of this company ANTVR is actually a fan of science fiction and his interest in this field made him invent this product. As well as, the first prototype of this product was made by the founder himself. In the year 2014, ANTVR effectively finished advertisement for the very first universal virtual reality gear, the ANTVR Kit 1, which is also called Kickstarter.</p><p><strong>4. Ling VR</strong></p><p> It’s a fine constructed and durable viewing design with fair about all being adaptable as well as the headbands it must be appropriate for most of the smartphones and also people乫s heads and sight. While the main material of the gadget is plastic but the face stole is a lenient foam making for a more contented watching experience. Well, this is also not an HMD that will shock anybody away, but it will help to a lot of people to get satisfied with what they brought.</p><p><strong>5. Baofeng Mojing VR 3 and 4</strong></p><p> The two headsets appear to be a bit dissimilar right off because of the presence of head strap in the later version. The preceding kind had the typical three-point method, holding the headset by using the sides and also with a 3rd strap up and over the upper of your head. The innovative version has only a single circular container that cracks in at the top of the headset and then has a modifiable plastic doodad on the posterior part. It’s showier, but it is much tougher to adjust it to remain steady on the skull.</p><p><strong>6. 3Glasses</strong></p><p> The lenses in the 3Glasses provide 110-degree of the Field of Vision (FOV), which is very typical these days in this technology. A couple of sliders on the lowest of the headset confirm that you are able to regulate the lenses to tie your wants, as an alternative to using an immovable system. The comprised 2K resolution display of this headset means you get coarsely 1080p per eye, which is not fairly as solid as the selling varieties of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135349/19272" target="_top" id="2135349">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135349" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135349/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Brief-history-of-Chinese-Virtual-Reality-Headset"><a href="#Brief-history-of-Chinese-Virtual-Reality-Headset" class="headerlink" title="Brief history of Chinese Virtual Reality Headset"></a>Brief history of Chinese Virtual Reality Headset</h2><p> If we talk about these new headsets, we see that almost of these kinds are same in shape and design. In adding to being more nice-looking, the modern Chinese headsets are comfortable, wide field of views, light-weight, have adjustable lenses, and in contrast to the Gear VR, the Chinese designs work with any of the latest smartphones instead of being restricted to just a single brand. The succeeding phase of development for Chinese headsets is going to be complicated and includes transforming headsets from modest dumb cases with lenses to audiences with further built-in technological advancement such as additional sensors, volume controls and back buttons, trackpads, as well as simulated interface situations and conventional application stores. Some Chinese producers have by now started working on virtual reality surroundings that permit operators to steer between dissimilar apps without taking the smartphone out of the headset, but they are presently frequently or totally in Chinese.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068417/7443" target="_top" id="2068417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068417/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Comparison-Between-Mainstream-VR-Headset-and-Chinese-Headset"><a href="#Comparison-Between-Mainstream-VR-Headset-and-Chinese-Headset" class="headerlink" title="Comparison Between Mainstream VR Headset and Chinese Headset"></a>Comparison Between Mainstream VR Headset and Chinese Headset</h2><p> Virtual Reality has revolutionized the technological world, people are going crazy about this technology and trying it at any cost. In the earlier days of the launch of VR headset, there were only a few brands with a very high cost of products. But with the passage of time, many other companies have made such products at very low costs. Today China has revolutionized the virtual reality even more by producing some of the best products on very low prices so that most people don’t go for the overly priced brands because they are getting approximately the same technology at considerably low prices.</p><p> Let’s mention here some of the best from both brands. Bobo VR Z3 only for $18 and on the other hand Samsun Gear VR for $99. A huge difference in their prices but a very low difference in their quality. And also VR Shinecon for just $23 and LG 360 VR for $199, and the same thing also about them, a huge difference of price but a little difference in quality. So, Chinese market does getting in this race and it is good to say that they are winning too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

According to the German director Werner Herzog, we have a nice technology but we do not have any idea about how to fill that technology with content. While in one hand developers are a bit confused regarding the development of a VR game and on the other hand, users are frustrated with the quantity of content. But the scenario will soon change expected by the experts.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-cost-of-creating-VR-content-is-too-high"><a href="#The-cost-of-creating-VR-content-is-too-high" class="headerlink" title="The cost of creating VR content is too high"></a>The cost of creating VR content is too high</h2><p> There is very little doubt regarding the acceptability and advancement of this technology but there are some bitter realities about this technology that users have to accept. The very first one is the cost. There is no denying that the cost of making a VR game or video is quite a few times higher than normal. So, the developers have to think of it in advance and if they are not a big company, it becomes difficult most of the time. What if the VR game or movie flops? It is quite possible and in such situations, managing the money becomes really very difficult. And there is time concern as well. And according to the market experts, the return on investment is very low. So, the developers who will be crating the VR games will be in fix whether that will make them profit or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-bitter-reality.jpg"                      alt="vr-bitter-reality "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123750/7443" target="_top" id="2123750">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123750" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123750/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-quality-of-VR-headset-is-not-stable"><a href="#The-quality-of-VR-headset-is-not-stable" class="headerlink" title="The quality of VR headset is not stable"></a>The quality of VR headset is not stable</h2><p> Well, now let’s focus on the quality of the VR headsets. Hundreds of companies are there offering these headsets. All are claiming theirs to be the best but what is the truth? Many of them are not even close to the standard that the viewers expect. The problem mostly persists with the small companies. There is no issue with the big brands like Oculus, HTC, and PSVR. But if you want to compromise with the price, you will end buy buying a piece of crap. And then comes the question of content. You are spending hundreds of dollars for a VR headset and just within a month you are out of content. So, what is the point of buying one then? This makes the buyers really very confused. And to be very frank with you, there is no particular solution to it yet.</p><p> So, what should be done? Whether the buyers should buy costly headsets or they should buy a cheap one since they are going to experience the lack of content soon? Well, giving the answer may be a bit tough right at this moment but the scenario will change soon. VR video, 360 degree photography, these are still very new and should be given some time to explore. The method of VR video is still exploring, the camera angles, shooting angles, lights, requirements; everything is very much new and there is no set standard yet. But with the constant advancement, visitors will soon experience a whole new set of contents that will change their video watching and gaming experience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-content-quality.jpg"                      alt="vr-content-quality "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975562">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975562">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975562.png"                      style="border: none;

Users with Facebook profiles use it as an identifier for other sites, seeing and sharing their videos and images, and much more. For some users, the video they post may not have the right video speed and want to change it. For example, if the length of the video is too long or the main person presenting the video is a slow speaker.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no preset setting on Facebook to increase the playback speed. So, <strong>can you speed up Facebook videos</strong> still?</p><p>The answer is yes, mainly with the help of other tools. In this article, let’s discuss the <strong>Facebook video speed controller</strong> options and how to carry out the process. Learn the step-by-step procedure and methods to carry it out on various device types here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/deep-dive-into-the-best-ways-to-speed-up-facebook-videos-1.jpg"                      alt="add an extension for increasing video speed"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-Best-Solutions-for-Changing-the-Speed-of-Videos-on-Facebook"><a href="#The-Best-Solutions-for-Changing-the-Speed-of-Videos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="The Best Solutions for Changing the Speed of Videos on Facebook"></a>The Best Solutions for Changing the Speed of Videos on Facebook</h2><p>Multiple suitable solutions are available for users to try changing the Facebook videos they watch or play. One major reason to <strong>speed up Facebook videos</strong> for people is the typical size of this content.

The software is accessible on desktop, in both Mac and Windows devices.

All the speed changing methods available here are simple to use and get used to on this software.</p><p>The three main speed adjustment methods of Filmora include:</p><p><strong>1.

After inserting the file, you can click on it and drag it to the editor timeline. There, right-click on it and choose Unform Speed. You can change the speed range and other options in the window for Uniform Speed.</p><p><strong>2.

Or, right-click the video clip in the timeline and choose Speed Ramping.</p><p>There are 6 preset templates available for keyframe-based speed adjustment on this software.

Change Speed via Timeline</strong></p><p>One of the easiest methods to <strong>speed up Facebook videos</strong> on Filmora is selecting and using the slider on the timeline to change speed. You can select the video clip and click on the icon for speed, shown as a tiny clock. Then, from the drop-down menu, click on Fast option and choose the speed between 2x to 100x.</p><p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide to Speed Up a Video on Filmora</strong></p><p>While there are three different ways to change video speed, here are the steps for the most notable one- Unform Speed-based changes.</p><p>Step1 Launch the Filmora software and click on Create New Project.</p><p>Step2 Import the Facebook video you downloaded from your device. Drag it onto the editor timeline at the lower part of the screen.</p><p>Step3 You can right-click on the video clip in the timeline and choose Uniform from the drop-down menu.

In this case, it is best to use different external solutions that you can install to make speed changes to the video. Browser extensions are useful for desktop users, while iOS and Android users can try apps.</p><p>However, it would be best to use third-party software like Filmora after downloading the video separately for superior-quality video speed changes. There are multiple speed settings, and each one is easy to use.</p><p>Try all the methods mentioned in this post and watch the video on Facebook at your preferred speed choice.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-links.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-bridging-language-barriers-adding-subtitles-to-windows-media-player/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Bridging Language Barriers Adding Subtitles to Windows Media Player</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-reversing-macos-sierra-update-to-os-x-el-capitan/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Reversing MacOS Sierra Update to OS X El Capitan</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-how-to-live-stream-over-the-network-with-vlc-media-player/"><u>[New] How to Live Stream Over the Network with VLC Media Player</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-step-by-step-guide-to-lut-mastery-for-2024/"><u>[New] Step-by-Step Guide to LUT Mastery for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-the-smartphone-lens-creating-sweeping-panos-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Smartphone Lens Creating Sweeping Panos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/nlock-your-potential-50-free-high-impact-banners-at-your-disposal/"><u>[New] Unlock Your Potential 50 FREE, High-Impact Banners at Your Disposal</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-perfectly-sync-apple-music-to-your-videos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Perfectly Sync Apple Music to Your Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-seamless-transition-turning-mac-videos-into-discs/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Seamless Transition Turning Mac Videos Into Discs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-efficiently-capture-and-record-your-idevice-screen-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Efficiently Capture and Record Your iDevice Screen for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-capturing-the-world-in-full-circle-experts-360-cams-review-2023/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Capturing the World in Full Circle - Expert's 360 Cams Review, 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-navigating-costs-in-youtube-promotional-efforts/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Navigating Costs in YouTube Promotional Efforts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-pixelperfect-tools-overview-series/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, PixelPerfect Tools Overview Series</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-monetary-milestones-pewdiepies-income-summary/"><u>[Updated] Monetary Milestones PewDiePie’s Income Summary</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-sure.techidaily.com/d-shorts-missing-on-youtube-screen-for-2024/"><u>Ceased Shorts Missing on YouTube Screen for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-track-imei-number-of-realme-c55-through-google-earth-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How To Track IMEI Number Of Realme C55 Through Google Earth?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/pokemon-go-no-gps-signal-heres-every-possible-solution-on-samsung-galaxy-m34-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Pokemon Go No GPS Signal?
