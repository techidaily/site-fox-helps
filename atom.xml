Both of these software offer unique media management services but when it comes to professional level real time applications then careful selection becomes essential. The article below can help you to make detailed comparison between VLC and MPC; probably you will soon be able to decide the right solution for your needs.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Comparison-of-VLC-and-MPC"><a href="#Comparison-of-VLC-and-MPC" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of VLC and MPC"></a>Comparison of VLC and MPC</h2><h3 id="User-Interface"><a href="#User-Interface" class="headerlink" title="User Interface"></a>User Interface</h3><p>There are very limited things to talk about user interfaces of both these software; they are quite simple. The design for MPC-HC is actually derived from its predecessor Media Player Classic and it originally follows the design track of Windows XP&#x2F;95 Media player. On the other side, VLC offers quite clunky icons with deep orange color that most of the time appear irritating to eyes.</p><p>The real difference lies between their features and menus where MPC-HC offers much organized service. It keeps all things at right place for both full screen and small screen modes whereas in case of VLC, users often need to organise a search for their desired content. MPC-HC retains its size even when video loops are formed but VLC immediately holds back the control to whole screen whenever playbacks start.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1793213">                    <video width="864" height="1296" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19135-1793213">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1793213.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftinyland.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1793213%2F19135'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793213/19135"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Video-Support"><a href="#Video-Support" class="headerlink" title="Video Support"></a>Video Support</h3><p>When video files were tested on both these platforms, MPC-HC provides decent results. Even the 4K content was displayed well on MPC-HC but VLC caused little loss for frames while missing the smoothness in between.</p><p>MPC performed better for almost all media file tests but its performance decayed little bit with old MPEG-1 file format. However, both these players found difficulties for seeking track over WMV files but VLC somehow managed the longer jumps. When tests were performed for DVD and VCDs then both players performed better while handling all menus and elements with ease. Performance for non-protected type Blu-ray files was also significant in both cases.</p><p>The sad thing about VLC is that when it finds some problem for playing any media file then it often goes into infinite loops and they can be finally broken only with task manager. But in case of MPC-HC, when some files appear un supported to this platform it simply says no to it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2148619/17108" target="_top" id="2148619">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2148619" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="100" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2148619/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Audio-Support"><a href="#Audio-Support" class="headerlink" title="Audio Support"></a>Audio Support</h3><p>MPC-HC as well as VLC, both these file formats supported WAV files perfectly up to 96KHz up to 32 bits. It also extends great support to standard compressed media file formats like APE&lt; FLAC, M4A, MP3 and Opus. You cannot play .VQF files on both these platforms.</p><p>VLC also finds trouble with Windows lossless files but MPC-HC can handle them well along with Apple Lossless content. In case of CD based playbacks, both these players worked well whereas performance of VLC was much smoother for track switching needs.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2012401/19272" target="_top" id="2012401">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2012401" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2012401/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Subtitles"><a href="#Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Subtitles"></a>Subtitles</h3><p>For most of the subtitle tests, MPC-HC performed with acceptable quality but in case of VLC you have to drag subtitle file on top of the movie so that it can play it in synchronism. MPC-HC handles subtitles as playable files and let them proceed normally.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148649/16836" target="_top" id="2148649">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148649" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148649/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Streaming-Support"><a href="#Streaming-Support" class="headerlink" title="Streaming Support"></a>Streaming Support</h3><p>This service is simply incredible in case of VLC and that is why it is well known as VideoLAN. Users simply need to copy video URL from internet and get it pasted on Open Media Stream dialogue box of VLV. You will definitely have great streaming experience for almost all YouTube videos but it is advised not to try such tricks with MPC-HC because it cannot handle.</p><h3 id="Photo-Format-Support"><a href="#Photo-Format-Support" class="headerlink" title="Photo Format Support"></a>Photo Format Support</h3><p>None of these software platforms is actually designed to handle images and you should not even expect slide show playbacks from them. But still during tests, VLC was able to open many images except JPEG and PNG files whereas MPC-HC effectively displayed BMP images, uncompressed as well as compressed TIFF, animated and static GIF, PNG and TGA files. But MPC-HC reported sudden failure for JPEG content; however it was later displayed well. If you don’t need to access JPEG content then MPC-HC can be a suitable option for your needs as it can handle most of the extensions with ease.</p><h3 id="Support-for-Filters-Shaders-and-FX"><a href="#Support-for-Filters-Shaders-and-FX" class="headerlink" title="Support for Filters, Shaders and FX"></a>Support for Filters, Shaders and FX</h3><p>VLC as well as MPC-HC, both these players work with standard speed and you can jump to different points of material with ease. However, VLC is well known for its incredible smoothness offered for slow playbacks so that original pitch can be retained; whereas this thing is not so in MPC-HC. MPC-HC further offers more advanced controls like interactive magnification etc that you may find behind dialogue boxes.</p><p>It is also possible to use advanced filters in case of MPC-HC, the range includes emboss, edge sharpen and gray scale options. The facility of FX and shaders is good in case of VLC also.</p><h3 id="Odds-and-Ends"><a href="#Odds-and-Ends" class="headerlink" title="Odds and Ends"></a>Odds and Ends</h3><p>VLC offers great controls over volume whereas MPC-HC follows boosts for dialogue delivery only. MPC-HC is observed to open up faster and its drag and drop features are much faster including 4K content support but all these things are even equally good for VLC platform too.</p><h2 id="VLC-and-MPC-Alternatives"><a href="#VLC-and-MPC-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="VLC and MPC Alternatives"></a>VLC and MPC Alternatives</h2><p>If you are searching for few <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >best free video players for PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as useful alternatives to both VLC and MPC then these three can be good choice for you:</p><h3 id="1-GOM-Player"><a href="#1-GOM-Player" class="headerlink" title="1.GOM Player"></a>1.<a class="link"   href="https://www.gomlab.com/" >GOM Player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>GOM player is available for free and it extends support to almost all popular audio&#x2F;video file formats.

We have all seen the commercials where senior people have a shaky video, and after it is fixed, we see that they are doing some amazing things but aren’t even moving. Shake reduction is one of the best features of Photoshop. It removes shakiness from a video, but it can also remove the movement from a picture. In this article, we’ll look at the use of Photoshop shake reduction, how it works, what it does, and how you can avoid using it.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</a></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect"><a href="#What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect" class="headerlink" title="What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?"></a>What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</h2><p>The Shake Reduction effect is something that many photographers do not need. It was added to Photoshop because of the number of pictures coming in with a blurring caused by camera movement while the shutter button was pressed. This blurring is called camera shake, and it can be not easy to get rid of in post-processing if you don’t have tools to help you fix it. The Shake Reduction feature introduced in Photoshop attempts to help with this problem.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop is a very useful feature that allows you to remove the effects of camera shake from your photos. It can also be used as a creative effect, allowing you to distort your images for some interesting effects intentionally.</p><p>Trying to take great photos with a handheld camera will always result in some blurring and camera shake. Even the best photographers can’t hold the camera completely steady for long periods of time. Unless you’re on a tripod, there’s always the chance that your photos are going to end up slightly blurred, especially if you’re shooting in low light or at high speeds.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop allows you to fix this problem by removing the blur and restoring crispness to your images.</p><h2 id="Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake"><a href="#Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake" class="headerlink" title="Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?"></a>Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</h2><p>The perfect shot is a fine balance of elements. You need the right lighting and the ideal setting, and you must also have precise timing. When it comes to taking a picture or photo, timing is very important. You don’t want to miss that perfect moment when the sun rays behind the clouds hit your face just right or when you capture your friend jumping off a diving board at just the right angle.</p><p>But sometimes, even if you do have everything in place and make sure you get the timing right, your picture can still turn out to be blurry. That’s where the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect comes in handy.</p><p>Shake Reduction is a feature that creates motion blur from camera shake, and many photographers consider it to be one of the most useful tools in Photoshop.</p><p>Some photographers prefer to use the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect instead of dealing with blurry photos. The main reason for this is that it can help them save time and effort when editing their images.</p><p>The Shake Reduction filter can also correct for perspective distortion introduced by tilting the camera up or down. It can compensate for uneven lighting, too. And one of the features that I find most impressive is that it can automatically remove video noise from old video transfers.</p><p>Truly, this effect is very useful, but not necessarily for fixing camera shake. In this tutorial, we will show you how to use Shake Reduction to create realistic depictions of motion. You will learn how to achieve different results by modifying the settings of Shake Reduction and combining it with other effects and filters in Photoshop.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-Shake-Reduction-in-Photoshop"><a href="#How-to-use-Shake-Reduction-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?"></a>How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</h2><p>A special Photoshop filter called Camera Shake Reduction can reduce blurriness in any image.

We have all seen the commercials where senior people have a shaky video, and after it is fixed, we see that they are doing some amazing things but aren’t even moving. Shake reduction is one of the best features of Photoshop. It removes shakiness from a video, but it can also remove the movement from a picture. In this article, we’ll look at the use of Photoshop shake reduction, how it works, what it does, and how you can avoid using it.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</a></p><h2 id="What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect-3"><a href="#What-is-the-Photoshop-Shake-Reduction-effect-3" class="headerlink" title="What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?"></a>What is the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect?</h2><p>The Shake Reduction effect is something that many photographers do not need. It was added to Photoshop because of the number of pictures coming in with a blurring caused by camera movement while the shutter button was pressed. This blurring is called camera shake, and it can be not easy to get rid of in post-processing if you don’t have tools to help you fix it. The Shake Reduction feature introduced in Photoshop attempts to help with this problem.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop is a very useful feature that allows you to remove the effects of camera shake from your photos. It can also be used as a creative effect, allowing you to distort your images for some interesting effects intentionally.</p><p>Trying to take great photos with a handheld camera will always result in some blurring and camera shake. Even the best photographers can’t hold the camera completely steady for long periods of time. Unless you’re on a tripod, there’s always the chance that your photos are going to end up slightly blurred, especially if you’re shooting in low light or at high speeds.</p><p>The Shake Reduction effect in Photoshop allows you to fix this problem by removing the blur and restoring crispness to your images.</p><h2 id="Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake-3"><a href="#Is-the-Shake-Reduction-effect-really-useful-to-fix-the-camera-shake-3" class="headerlink" title="Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?"></a>Is the Shake Reduction effect really useful to fix the camera shake?</h2><p>The perfect shot is a fine balance of elements. You need the right lighting and the ideal setting, and you must also have precise timing. When it comes to taking a picture or photo, timing is very important. You don’t want to miss that perfect moment when the sun rays behind the clouds hit your face just right or when you capture your friend jumping off a diving board at just the right angle.</p><p>But sometimes, even if you do have everything in place and make sure you get the timing right, your picture can still turn out to be blurry. That’s where the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect comes in handy.</p><p>Shake Reduction is a feature that creates motion blur from camera shake, and many photographers consider it to be one of the most useful tools in Photoshop.</p><p>Some photographers prefer to use the Photoshop Shake Reduction effect instead of dealing with blurry photos. The main reason for this is that it can help them save time and effort when editing their images.</p><p>The Shake Reduction filter can also correct for perspective distortion introduced by tilting the camera up or down. It can compensate for uneven lighting, too. And one of the features that I find most impressive is that it can automatically remove video noise from old video transfers.</p><p>Truly, this effect is very useful, but not necessarily for fixing camera shake. In this tutorial, we will show you how to use Shake Reduction to create realistic depictions of motion. You will learn how to achieve different results by modifying the settings of Shake Reduction and combining it with other effects and filters in Photoshop.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-Shake-Reduction-in-Photoshop-3"><a href="#How-to-use-Shake-Reduction-in-Photoshop-3" class="headerlink" title="How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?"></a>How to use Shake Reduction in Photoshop?</h2><p>A special Photoshop filter called Camera Shake Reduction can reduce blurriness in any image. Several factors can lead to blurred images, including slow shutter speeds, long focal lengths, and unsteady hands. Smart extrapolation detects the blurry path and sharpens the image at those points. Besides controlling sharpening for different areas of an image, the Filter’s interface also lets you override Photoshop’s auto-analysis. Want to use the photoshop shake reduction effect?

You want a lot of bright natural light, but not streaming directly through your windows as this creates shadows.</p><p>If the kitchen doesn’t work well for you, experiment with other rooms or outside, but be sure to keep furniture and clutter out of your shots.</p><h4 id="2-Audio"><a href="#2-Audio" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio"></a>2. Audio</h4><p>Audio is one of the main components that sets <a class="link"   href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/visiting-seefood-media-food-videography/" >food videography <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> apart from food photography. There are two viable options. You can either set your video to music, which will help set the tone for your frame speed, or you can use a voice over to provide audible descriptions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-audio.JPG"                      alt="audio"                ></p><h4 id="3-Try-to-Tell-a-Story"><a href="#3-Try-to-Tell-a-Story" class="headerlink" title="3. Try to Tell a Story"></a>3. Try to Tell a Story</h4><p>What seems like an insignificant change can be monumental. When crafting recipe videos, you want to try telling a story.</p><p>For example, instead of showing a mixer you could show a mother helping her child to mix the ingredients together. At the end of the clip, you could either show only the food, or you could show a man walking past the window with his dog in tow.</p><p>Telling a story will help to pull watchers into your video so they watch through until the end. It’s all about making viewers as invested as possible in a very short time frame.</p><p>If you don’t start pulling them in, such as by telling a story, in the first twenty seconds, they probably won’t continue watching.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/food-sell-a-story.JPG"                      alt="food"                ></p><h4 id="4-Video-Editing"><a href="#4-Video-Editing" class="headerlink" title="4. Video Editing"></a>4. Video Editing</h4><p>Once the video is shot, you’ll have to do some post-production work. In other words, you need to edit your video. This is more time consuming than with food photography, because you must edit by frame, place to music, add title frames, and so on.</p><p>One major mistake people make with their food videos is the use of too many transitions or cut-scenes, such as fading, zoom outs, etc.</p><p>The best way to edit your videos is for quality, with a minimum of 90-97% straight shots – meaning no transitions are used.</p><h4 id="5-Decoration"><a href="#5-Decoration" class="headerlink" title="5. Decoration"></a>5. Decoration</h4><p>Some people will choose to shoot their videos using bold, bright colors in their food and setting.</p><p>Others may decide that a simple setting – such as a classic wooden table with nothing more than a small flower vase – is more suitable for the dish they are creating.</p><p>Both are great choices, but the key is to base your settings off your dish, ensuring the area surrounding the food is complementary and not contrasting.</p><p>Videographers may choose to use other techniques to make the final dish pop.</p><p>This could include food carving, plating techniques, or even just the use of high-tech equipment which has the potential to capture even the tiniest food fragment in vivid detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/food-decoration.JPG"                      alt="decoration food"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151869/7443" target="_top" id="2151869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Equipment"><a href="#Equipment" class="headerlink" title="Equipment"></a>Equipment</h2><h4 id="1-Smart-Phone"><a href="#1-Smart-Phone" class="headerlink" title="1. Smart Phone"></a>1. Smart Phone</h4><p>One way to shoot food videos is with your smart phone. To do this, use the built-in camera feature set to take video in landscape mode (this looks the best).</p><p>Hold very still to prevent shaking, and simply hold the screen for autofocus and exposure prior to beginning your film.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-7-plus-4k-smartphone.jpg"                      alt="smart phone"                ></p><h4 id="2-Lens"><a href="#2-Lens" class="headerlink" title="2. Lens"></a>2. Lens</h4><p>If you are going to shoot with a camera, you need either a mirrorless camera or DSLR. A standard click-and-shoot will not provide a high enough quality of video. Along with a high-quality camera comes the need for a high-quality lens.</p><p>The lens you shoot with should be able to zoom in or out on the food. You’ll want to avoid a lens that presents static, or has any nicks, chips, or cuts in the glass.</p><p>As for the shooting itself, you can feel free to experiment with lenses that offer unique styles, such as soft or hard</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fujinon-mk18-55mm-t2.9-lens.jpg"                      alt="lens"                ></p><h4 id="3-Tripod"><a href="#3-Tripod" class="headerlink" title="3. Tripod"></a>3. Tripod</h4><p>Another thing you’ll want when shooting with a camera is a tripod. A tripod is necessary because it holds the camera steady, as well as allows you to be present in the video if desired.</p><p>You can find a cheap tripod at many chain stores to get you started, although you may want to invest in a better one in the future.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gitzo-mountaineer-series-2-carbon-fiber-tripod.jpg"                      alt="tripod"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087267/19272" target="_top" id="2087267">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087267" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087267/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This basic guide should give you a solid start in creating top-of-the-line food videography for your social media accounts.</p><p>If you find your first video isn’t as amazing as you’d thought it would be, remember that it takes time to become a master at something.

Moreover, while uploading a 4K video, you need to adhere to the file parameters like frame rate, bit rate, and container as recommended by YouTube.</p><p>In order to overcome all these issues and others related to 4K uploading, the best solution is to downscale the video to the highest quality. To get this conversion done, you would need a good PC or an online tool. For your convenience, we have shortlisted the best tools for downscaling 4K YouTube videos and they are discussed in the following parts of the topic.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Is-a-4K-video-necessary-for-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-Is-a-4K-video-necessary-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Is a 4K video necessary for YouTube?"></a>Part 1: Is a 4K video necessary for YouTube?</h2><p>Though 4K video is supported by YouTube, these are not at all necessary for YouTube. In fact, uploading a 4K video is more of a hassle as it not only takes a lot of time but needs to adhere to the set file parameters. Moreover, these 4K videos are cumbersome to edit and also, and they are not supported by a wide range of media players and devices. The large size of the 4K videos also prevents them from being shared over email and other platforms.</p><p>Considering all these factors, downscaling 4K videos to 1080p&#x2F;HD is the best solution as this will not hamper the video quality and will also make the uploading, editing, and playback easy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141680/17091" target="_top" id="2141680">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2141680" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141680/17091"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Top-5-Software-to-Downscale-4K-to-1080p-HD-without-Losing-Quality-for-YouTube"><a href="#Part-2-Top-5-Software-to-Downscale-4K-to-1080p-HD-without-Losing-Quality-for-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Among the above-listed ones, we would recommend using Wondershare Filmora as it works as a complete video editing toolbox that will help you with several other video editing and customization tasks.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-navigating-the-dynamic-world-of-drone-racing-and-top-5-high-speed-drones/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Navigating the Dynamic World of Drone Racing & Top 5 High-Speed Drones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-uncovering-superior-free-viewers-for-your-webm-media-files/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Uncovering Superior, Free Viewers for Your WebM Media Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-discover-10-exceptional-commodity-lut-files/"><u>[New] In 2024, Discover 10 Exceptional Commodity LUT Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-blend-sounds-in-presentation-ppts-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Blend Sounds in Presentation PPTs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-leading-music-service-streaming-channels-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Leading Music Service Streaming Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-snapshot-stability-mastering-motion/"><u>[Updated] Snapshot Stability Mastering Motion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-visual-ventures-partnership-playbook-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Visual Ventures Partnership Playbook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/2024-approved-how-to-add-video-filters-in-zoom/"><u>2024 Approved How To Add Video Filters In Zoom</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/8-solutions-to-solve-youtube-app-crashing-on-itel-a60s-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>8 Solutions to Solve YouTube App Crashing on Itel A60s | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/android-to-apple-how-to-transfer-photos-from-nokia-c32-to-ipad-easily-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>Android to Apple How To Transfer Photos From Nokia C32 to iPad Easily | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/android-users-handbook-the-process-of-deactivating-facebook-apps/"><u>Android Users' Handbook: The Process of Deactivating Facebook Apps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/full-guide-on-mirroring-your-motorola-razr-40-ultra-to-your-pcmac-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Full Guide on Mirroring Your Motorola Razr 40 Ultra to Your PC/Mac | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-missing-music-files-from-itel-by-fonelab-android-recover-music/"><u>How To Restore Missing Music Files from Itel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/the-art-of-individuality-with-ai-instructing-chatgpt-to-reflect-you/"><u>The Art of Individuality with AI: Instructing ChatGPT to Reflect You</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/twitters-new-era-of-videography-aspect-ratios-mandatory-for-2024/"><u>Twitter's New Era of Videography Aspect Ratios Mandatory for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You should do this only if the video is in your niche and the channel has a lot of subscribers (over 1,000). When you comment, make sure that you engage with the creator and add value to the conversation. If they ask a question, answer it! If they want feedback, give them some! If they ask for help with something, offer advice or information. And if someone comments on one of your videos asking for help with something related to what you’re talking about in your video—don’t ignore them! Reply back right away so that people see that interaction on their newsfeeds and find out more about what you have to say about it.</p><p>This might seem like an obvious way to get more views but I’ve seen many creators who don’t interact much with other channels because they think their audience won’t care about what other people are doing or saying online.

If you have trouble uploading that often, try to upload a video every two weeks or so. If that’s not feasible, at least make sure you have one ready to go before the end of the month so you can post it before the next month begins.</p><p>To make sure that videos get uploaded regularly without hassle, put them on a schedule (e.g., Monday through Friday). This way, you know when each new video will come out so there’s no stress about missing the deadline for getting it online in time for its scheduled release date.</p><p>The best way to ensure regularity is by setting up an automated scheduler with analytics services like Tubebuddy that will automatically publish your content while also keeping track of when each new episode goes live on YouTube and how many views each receives over time—helping predict what kind of clip is likely to be most popular among viewers based on past trends</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1328679">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1328679">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1328679.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fthefitville.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1328679%2F15852'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1328679/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="8-Add-calls-to-action-at-the-beginning-of-your-video"><a href="#8-Add-calls-to-action-at-the-beginning-of-your-video" class="headerlink" title="#8.

While this may be important for those who are looking to sell a product or service—and these types of things should definitely be mentioned at some point in your video—the majority of your viewers are not going to want to hear about how great you are.</p><p>If you want to grow an audience on YouTube and get more views, then one thing you need to do is provide value. This could mean sharing tips and tricks, answering questions from viewers or promoting other channels that produce great content related to your niche (which will encourage them share it with their friends).</p><h2 id="10-Use-playlists-effectively-to-get-more-views"><a href="#10-Use-playlists-effectively-to-get-more-views" class="headerlink" title="#10.

They allow you to group together related videos, making it easier for viewers to find what they’re looking for and watch more of your content. They also help in the search engine optimization (SEO) of those videos!</p><p>If you’re looking to create a series of videos, playlists are an ideal way to do so. You could create one playlist with all the episodes of your new show, or have separate playlists for each episode so people can binge-watch them all at once if they want to.</p><p>Playlists can also be used as a place where viewers can watch related content that isn’t necessarily part of another video—for example if someone just really likes one thing from one video but would like other similar things too (like say music from several artists).</p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>We hope this post has helped you get more views for your YouTube videos! If you follow these steps, we promise that your channel will be full of high-quality content in no time. Remember to take it slow and don’t try to do everything at once. The most important thing is to stick with it - if you keep uploading videos every week and posting comments back on other people’s channels (and interacting with commenters), then an audience will come along eventually.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-designing-multi-layered-photographic-illusions/"><u>[New] Designing Multi-Layered Photographic Illusions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-enhance-video-aesthetics-instagram-border-techniques/"><u>[New] In 2024, Enhance Video Aesthetics Instagram Border Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-pixel-perfect-review-amd-radeon/"><u>[New] Pixel Perfect Review AMD Radeon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-capture-composition-ideal-plugins-and-websites-to-frame-your-images-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Capture Composition Ideal Plugins and Websites to Frame Your Images for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-intuitive-podcast-beginnings-charismatic-hooks/"><u>[Updated] Intuitive Podcast Beginnings Charismatic Hooks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-peeking-at-high-resolution-display-innovation-the-dell-p2715q-review-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Peeking at High-Resolution Display Innovation - The Dell P2715Q Review for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-premium-mp4-channel-updater-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Premium MP4 Channel Updater for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-holistic-locomotion-examination-2023/"><u>2024 Approved Holistic Locomotion Examination 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-webcam-buying-simplified-the-best-10-options/"><u>2024 Approved Webcam Buying Simplified The Best 10 Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/enhancing-productivity-in-human-resources-via-prompts/"><u>Enhancing Productivity in Human Resources via Prompts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/free-range-humor-development-unleash-your-wit/"><u>Free-Range Humor Development Unleash Your Wit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-unravel-the-mystery-of-scouring-exceptional-photos-on-pexels/"><u>In 2024, Unravel the Mystery of Scouring Exceptional Photos on Pexels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://graphic-issues.techidaily.com/nvidia-error-addressed-driver-returns-to-form/"><u>Nvidia Error Addressed - Driver Returns to Form</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/refine-gaming-atmosphere-personalizing-the-xbox-game-bar-for-a-besposkexpenses-windows-pc/"><u>Refine Gaming Atmosphere: Personalizing the Xbox Game Bar for a Besposkexpenses Windows PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/revive-your-experience-with-these-key-iphone-x-tips-for-2024/"><u>Revive Your Experience with These Key iPhone X Tips for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/step-by-step-implementing-effective-transitions-on-inshot-for-2024/"><u>Step-by-Step Implementing Effective Transitions on Inshot for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/-vibes-the-best-bgm-to-complement-your-yt-short-creations/"><u>Viral Vibes The Best BGM to Complement Your YT Short Creations</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You can easily save time when you use it, because you can capture the interior footage you want with little to no effort. They did a very good job at bringing a 120 FPS mode.

You need to make sure that you study the soil and field quality, not to mention you need to assess the health and irrigation of your crops. The DJI Agras MG-1 does a very good job here because its battery lasts for around 24 minutes. It’s a heavy drone at around 8.8 kg, but then again you do have a good and reliable drone that can be monitored and used in any way you want. The liquid tank capacity has around 10 liters and you can use it for spraying as well. They added a smart mode too and the motor is very good at managing battery power. It’s one of the best and most efficient drones out there for agricultural use and the experience you get from using it is very good.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> great features for agricultural use, suitable for spraying crops, great flight time duration</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive (Almost $15000), maneuverability can be better.</p><h4 id="4-Best-professional-drones-for-mapping-and-surveying-3DR-Site-Scan"><a href="#4-Best-professional-drones-for-mapping-and-surveying-3DR-Site-Scan" class="headerlink" title="4.

The price of around $12000 seems rather prohibitive, but the drone is particularly used for taking pictures and it does a very good job at that. It’s very stable and the camera comes with a stabilizer, so each one of the pictures works great and it manages to deliver an incredible value for your money because of that reason alone. You can use the captured images and footage to convert it into 3D models and contour maps if you want.</p><p> It works great for both enterprise and startup use, not to mention that its mapping features are great and to the point. You can charge it for around 1.5 hours, which is a pretty good time for a regular drone.</p><p> Also, you can outline the area that you want to survey on the map and the drone will fly itself. This is a nifty feature and one that many professional drones should start using sooner rather than later.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> You can outline the desired region and make it fly automatically, great image quality, stable and with a great performance.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong>  the price of around $12000 is rather high</p><h4 id="5-Best-drones-for-surveillance-Yuneec-Q500-Typhoon"><a href="#5-Best-drones-for-surveillance-Yuneec-Q500-Typhoon" class="headerlink" title="5.

Or, it may happen sometimes that SRT subtitles are grammatically wrong or aligned incorrectly with the video playback. Then, an effective subtitle editor could be helpful.</p><p>In this article, we will walk you through some best tools to show you how to adjust the .srt file style, speed, and placement.

Most third-party media players do showcase the SRT-based format easily. So, you can also use Preview apps or any other software to access and read the basic text documents on Mac.</p><p>However, the QuickTime player on Mac does not always support SRT in videos. You have to convert them to a format the QuickTime Player supports or utilize a third-party <strong>SRT editor Mac</strong> allows.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Programs-can-open-SRT-Files-on-Mac-and-How-to-do-it"><a href="#Part-2-What-Programs-can-open-SRT-Files-on-Mac-and-How-to-do-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Programs can open SRT Files on Mac, and How to do it?"></a>Part 2: What Programs can open SRT Files on Mac, and How to do it?</h2><p>Indeed, you have to install specific types of software on your Mac device if you want to **SRT edit Mac-**based videos.

Various image attributes such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point can be enhanced whether it is movies, videos, or still images.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-grading"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color grading?"></a>Part 1. What is color grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the process of stylizing the color scheme of your footage by “painting” over what you’ve created using color correction. After the colorist completes the color correction, they can begin the process of grading the footage. During color grading, colorists use editing software to stylize the shot – emphasizing the visual tone and atmosphere of the film and making it look more cinematic.</p><p>Color sorting can be used for both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color gradation for artistic purposes to ensure that a film’s carefully selected color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion. For example, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/"><em>American Beauty (1999)</em></a> uses redder in dramatic moments to represent passion, anger, and power, whereas <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310/"><em>Maleficent (2014)</em></a> uses green to represent danger, corruption, and darkness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-tutorial-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading tutorial"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial"></a>Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial</h2><h3 id="1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021"><a href="#1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="1.

They’re also easy to mount on almost any surface i-e., mounting onto your bike helmet makes it easy to capture every moment on your ride, so that it doesn’t matter where you are, you’ll be able to capture what’s happening around you.</p><p>GoPro time-lapse is a way to view the world from your camera’s point of view. It allows you to see everything that happened in a short period, either as it happens or over several days. You can use GoPro time-lapse to make videos about your daily life, or even about events like weddings, and vacations. You can use GoPro time-lapse for a more serious purpose.</p><p>There are many different cameras available on the market today that will work with GoPro time-lapse. Time-lapse videos are filmed at a constant speed and then edited together to create a video that shows the passage of time in real-time. In this blog post, we’ll explore why GoPro time-lapse is important, and how it can help you capture your memories.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-GoPro-Time-lapse-Video-Mode"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-GoPro-Time-lapse-Video-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is GoPro Time-lapse Video Mode"></a>Part 1: What is GoPro Time-lapse Video Mode</h2><p>GoPro time-lapse video mode allows you to create a video that shows the passage of time over a period of days or weeks. The video is created by taking photos at regular intervals and then editing them together so that they appear to run in real-time. One of the most popular uses of GoPro time-lapse videos is when you want to capture something in motion.</p><p>You can use this technique for many different types of subjects including landscapes, cars, people, and animals and you can even add sounds like birds chirping or waves crashing along with them! It’s also possible to make this type of video if you’re using any other camera brand than GoPro itself. This method produces high-quality videos that can be used as promotional material.</p><p>The GoPro time-lapse creates the final video by stitching together the individual still images into one long clip. The software also allows you to manipulate each frame individually, which can be used to adjust the focus and exposure settings of your shot. GoPro Time-lapse videos are videos that show a sequence of events over a substantial period.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/gopro-timelapse-video-mode.jpg"                      alt="gopro timelapse video mode"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-GoPro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-GoPro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with GoPro"></a>Part 2: How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with GoPro</h2><p>If you’re a videographer or photographer, you’ve probably considered shooting time-lapse videos. They’re great for showing the passage of time, but they can also be used to show the beauty of a place. With GoPro cameras, you can create a time-lapse video in just minutes. Here’s how to shoot your time-lapse video with GoPro.</p><h5 id="Step1-Choose-your-shooting-mode"><a href="#Step1-Choose-your-shooting-mode" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Choose your shooting mode"></a>Step1 Choose your shooting mode</h5><p>Firstly, choose the shooting mode, that is which kind of mode you want. If you want to shoot a time-lapse video then first click on the mode button and select the video mode. The video mode will be shown on the front screen after pressing it.</p><h5 id="Step2-Select-the-time-lapse-mode"><a href="#Step2-Select-the-time-lapse-mode" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Select the time-lapse mode"></a>Step2 Select the time-lapse mode</h5><p>Press the set-up button and go to the video settings which are held on the left side. After that click on the time-lapse video. There are many features and options in HERO8. There is a night lapse option in GoPro which is normally used in night photography. We can use this feature when there is limited lighting. The time-lapse mode was used in earlier models.</p><h5 id="Step3-Change-the-interval-settings"><a href="#Step3-Change-the-interval-settings" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Change the interval settings"></a>Step3 Change the interval settings</h5><p>Choosing the correct interval settings is essential to creating a professional-looking time-lapse video. The interval time is the amount of time between each frame in your video. 30 FPS is used by GoPro time-lapse which means 30 pictures are required for a one-second video. The first step to shooting a GoPro time-lapse video is choosing the interval settings.</p><p>This can be done through GoPro’s settings menu, which can be accessed by tapping the icon in the upper right corner of the main screen, then tapping “Settings” in the menu that appears. the camera will take pictures every few seconds while recording video, which is great if you’re trying to hit a certain number of frames per second (FPS).</p><h5 id="Step4-Mount-your-GoPro-and-click-on-the-shutter-button"><a href="#Step4-Mount-your-GoPro-and-click-on-the-shutter-button" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Mount your GoPro and click on the shutter button"></a>Step4 Mount your GoPro and click on the shutter button</h5><p>If you want to shoot time-lapse videos on a GoPro, first you’ll need to mount your camera. Then press the shutter button on your camera and start shooting. Attach the camera to the tripod with the adhesive mount provided. Set up your camera by adjusting the settings for exposure, ISO, and other options in the Settings menu (you can find these settings in the Settings tab)</p><p>You’ll probably want to use a wide-angle lens for this kind of video because you’ll want to capture as much of your surroundings as possible. If you want to change the length of time you want to shoot, press the button again until it says “Time Lapse” or whatever setting you want.</p><h5 id="Step5-Press-the-Shutter-Button-to-End-Shooting"><a href="#Step5-Press-the-Shutter-Button-to-End-Shooting" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Press the Shutter Button to End Shooting"></a>Step5 Press the Shutter Button to End Shooting</h5><p>When you are done with your shooting press the shutter button to end the shooting. GoPro will automatically combine all your clicked photos in a single video. You don’t need to do anything to combine the photos. The best part about this camera is that you can use it to shoot both vertical and horizontal time-lapses, as well as time-lapse photos.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Edit-Time-lapse-Video-on-Computer"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Edit-Time-lapse-Video-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on Computer"></a>Part 3: How to Edit Time-lapse Video on Computer</h2><p>Editing time-lapse videos can be a bit tricky, but with the right tools and a little bit of practice, you can create some stunning time-lapse videos that will amaze your friends and family.

Many editors add slow-motion effects to videos or parts to create a stylish and top-notch look.</p><p>However, this effect becomes a default in the videos after adding it, and users cannot easily deactivate the setting. It can get annoying to deal with when you are trying to play a video, but it starts automatically playing in slow-motion on your video player. Thus, for most users, learning <strong>how to change slow-motion video to normal-speed Android</strong> is important.</p><p>In general, there is no built-in feature that allows Android users to change recorded video speed, like reversing slow motion. So, it would be best if you considered third-party tools in this case. Multiple options are usable in this context, and we explain some of the best ones here. Interested?

Multiple apps come with varying speed range choices and speed ramping support.</p><p>It would help if you tried them all out before settling on the best one suited for your needs.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-lightning-fast-retrieval-of-vanished-reddit-discussions/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Lightning-Fast Retrieval of Vanished Reddit Discussions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-maximize-efficiency-with-wmp-for-audio-conversion-for-2024/"><u>[New] Maximize Efficiency with WMP for Audio Conversion for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-mastering-the-art-of-haul-video-shopping-showcasing-and-editing/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Mastering the Art of Haul Video Shopping, Showcasing & Editing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-aurora-hdr-assessment-excellence-or-overkill-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Aurora HDR Assessment Excellence or Overkill for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-the-lens-the-complete-selfie-confirmation-on-ig/"><u>[Updated] Beyond the Lens The Complete Selfie Confirmation on IG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/2-ways-to-monitor-vivo-y78t-activity-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>2 Ways to Monitor Vivo Y78t Activity | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/digitizing-memories-from-stillness-to-movement/"><u>Digitizing Memories From Stillness to Movement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-detailed-guide-on-faking-your-location-in-mozilla-firefox-on-oneplus-nord-3-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, A Detailed Guide on Faking Your Location in Mozilla Firefox On OnePlus Nord 3 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-step-by-step-vsco-image-enhancement/"><u>In 2024, Step-by-Step VSCO Image Enhancement</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/mastering-error-code-repairs-the-minecraft-crossbow-dilemma/"><u>Mastering Error Code Repairs: The Minecraft Crossbow Dilemma</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/new-here-you-will-find-top-10-best-free-and-paid-final-cut-pro-x-alternatives-that-you-can-use-on-windows-mac-or-linux-computer-for-2024/"><u>New Here, You Will Find Top 10 Best Free and Paid Final Cut Pro X Alternatives that You Can Use on Windows, Mac or Linux Computer for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-issues.techidaily.com/solving-sound-problems-repairing-logitech-g935-microphone-compatibility-with-windows/"><u>Solving Sound Problems: Repairing Logitech G935 Microphone Compatibility with Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/top-12-free-audio-converters-for-202-groovy-year-the-ultimate-guide/"><u>Top 12 Free Audio Converters for 202 Groovy Year - The Ultimate Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-topics.techidaily.com/updated-essential-tips-for-shooting-talking-head-videos/"><u>Updated Essential Tips for Shooting Talking Head Videos</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The most popular LUT format is “cube”. More so, it is quite compatible with several photo editors. Likewise, you can export your content to other platforms.</p><h2 id="Does-3D-LUT-have-a-mobile-app"><a href="#Does-3D-LUT-have-a-mobile-app" class="headerlink" title="Does 3D LUT have a mobile app?"></a>Does 3D LUT have a mobile app?</h2><p>Yes. 3D LUT has a mobile app version. You can use it to adjust your videos and photos from the comfort of your palms. It comprises these features.</p><p><strong>Basic color adjustment:</strong> This feature allows you to change your video or image color to your satisfaction. You can make it brighter or dull by moving the brightness bar to either the left or the right. Other adjustments are the contrast, saturation, and white balance.</p><p><strong>Choose your photos from the gallery:</strong> you don’t have to search for your data from other platforms. Simply choose photos or videos to use from the gallery. This applies to the earlier saved photos. However, you can also use your camera to shoot instant photos.</p><p><strong>Color correction:</strong> your image color could be too bright or dull. This feature enables you to correct the color to a perfect tone. Besides, you get to choose from a wide range of colors, or better still, do a quick mix even as you correct the needed sections.</p><p>You don’t intend to compose your video and miss an open platform to share your content. Use the export tab to instantly share your video or images once ed to perfection. You can use it for marketing or tutorials.</p><h3 id="The-3D-LUT-desktop-version"><a href="#The-3D-LUT-desktop-version" class="headerlink" title="The 3D LUT desktop version"></a>The 3D LUT desktop version</h3><p>The desktop version is the most widely used. It is powerful, with enough tools to carry out a couple of color grading effects.</p><h4 id="How-it-works"><a href="#How-it-works" class="headerlink" title="How it works"></a>How it works</h4><p>The 3D LUT Creator has a working image and a reference image. These are displayed side by side or top and bottom to show the “Before” and “After” effects. The best part is that you can comfortably interact with other programs such as After Effect and many more. The simplest way to add your content is to drag a photo from the Finder into the PS. Additionally, pasting your image from the clipboard also works well. This favors you when watching a video on a separate social media site like YouTube or Vimeo as long as you like the grading pattern. Use your desktop screenshot as a clipboard shortcut, then go to the 3D LUT Creator and hit “Command+V” to paste it.</p><p>Note that after you paste your content into the program, you should begin to work with your color. Here are some useful tools for the desktop version.</p><p><strong>The A&#x2F;B Grid:</strong> This tool enables you to change the hue and saturation of your image without affecting other colors. It is either square or circular, both with layered colors. You will notice the color wheel shows the control points with more saturation in the outer area, while less saturation is geared towards the center region. Nonetheless, it is quite easy to limit the colors on your screen, as you can choose to work with only a few at a time.</p><p><strong>C&#x2F;L Grid:</strong> This tool is for controlling the contrast of a specific color. Make use of it by rotating the axis angle to influence specific hues to work with.</p><p>Use this tool to control the saturation or luminance. This should be according to the existing state of your image, such as the current saturation. Likewise, you can use color swatches to perform color adjustments based on different color modes. Such color modes include SXY, YUV, CMYK, and RGBW, among others.</p><p><strong>Masking:</strong> This is another powerful tool capable of pulling an interesting color mixture.

These are displayed side by side or top and bottom to show the “Before” and “After” effects. The best part is that you can comfortably interact with other programs such as After Effect and many more. The simplest way to add your content is to drag a photo from the Finder into the PS. Additionally, pasting your image from the clipboard also works well. This favors you when watching a video on a separate social media site like YouTube or Vimeo as long as you like the grading pattern. Use your desktop screenshot as a clipboard shortcut, then go to the 3D LUT Creator and hit “Command+V” to paste it.</p><p>Note that after you paste your content into the program, you should begin to work with your color. Here are some useful tools for the desktop version.</p><p><strong>The A&#x2F;B Grid:</strong> This tool enables you to change the hue and saturation of your image without affecting other colors. It is either square or circular, both with layered colors. You will notice the color wheel shows the control points with more saturation in the outer area, while less saturation is geared towards the center region. Nonetheless, it is quite easy to limit the colors on your screen, as you can choose to work with only a few at a time.</p><p><strong>C&#x2F;L Grid:</strong> This tool is for controlling the contrast of a specific color. Make use of it by rotating the axis angle to influence specific hues to work with.</p><p>Use this tool to control the saturation or luminance. This should be according to the existing state of your image, such as the current saturation. Likewise, you can use color swatches to perform color adjustments based on different color modes. Such color modes include SXY, YUV, CMYK, and RGBW, among others.</p><p><strong>Masking:</strong> This is another powerful tool capable of pulling an interesting color mixture. You can create masks based on various aspects of the settings, like hue and warmth.</p><p>To download the app, visit the official website of 3D LUT Creator at:</p><p><a class="link"   href="http://3dlutcreator.com/" >http://3dlutcreator.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Concluding-Remarks-1"><a href="#Concluding-Remarks-1" class="headerlink" title="Concluding Remarks"></a>Concluding Remarks</h2><p><strong>●</strong> Working with <strong>the 3D LUT Creator</strong> is quite interesting.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Digital-Sculptors’-Playground-Essential-Tools-for-Every-Animator"><a href="#Digital-Sculptors’-Playground-Essential-Tools-for-Every-Animator" class="headerlink" title="Digital Sculptors’ Playground: Essential Tools for Every Animator"></a>Digital Sculptors’ Playground: Essential Tools for Every Animator</h2><p>Using software like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for editing your videos ready for uploading or release is fast and effective but first you have to get your files ready to import. We will be talking about 3d model creation today which is the first step in 3D animation creation. There are many options out there with their own advantages and drawbacks as well as price points and additional support via tutorials and in some cases assets to help speed up the creation process.</p><p>In every case you can always just buy ready-made models for your animations but in doing that you lose the option and the flexibility to have a completely custom asset with the ability to alter when needed.</p><p>There are many steps to creating that perfect video and in time you will have your preferred method. We call this our workflow. Achieving a comfortable workflow is one of the most important and influential processes you will undergo as a creative artist, this is due to the fact even with the best ideas and all the drive in the world, if you struggle to translate that into a 3d model then it stays in your head and no one will see it.</p><p>With this in mind let’s look at some of the options available to us and how we can use them for this first most important step in our creative process. Remember to pick one that does not limit your creativity and gives you the tools you need to translate thought into visualization.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="ZBrush-by-MAXON"><a href="#ZBrush-by-MAXON" class="headerlink" title="ZBrush by MAXON"></a>ZBrush by MAXON</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/zbrush-by-maxon.jpg"                      alt="zbrush by maxon"                ></p><p>Zbrush is what is considered an industry standard 3D modeling software and is one of the most used by many leading studios. This is a paid software with different versions meeting different needs depending on what you feel you need. You can create impressive 3d models with very high levels of detail without overusing your computer resources resulting in a stable and fluid working process. Zbrush is very powerful with many features, too many features to highlight in this guide but as an overview some features that can improve your process are:</p><ul><li>You can import or create alphas easily for micro detailing.</li><li>There is a live boolean to create unique items within your sculpts.</li><li>It’s very easy to use the Zremesher to create a new clean topology of your sculptures.<br> Dynamesh lets you work and retopo as you go so the sculpt retains detail.</li><li>Work with multiple levels of divisions at the same time with the Sub Divide tools.</li></ul><p>This is just a tiny scratch on the surface of what ZBrush can do. There are all the tools you need within this software to create an amazing jaw dropping model for your videos but this is a paid software which is important to remember when making the decision to go with this one as you will need animation and rigging software as well as in some cases a UV editor. Another thing to remember is system requirements depending on your setup. Minimum system requirements are as follows:</p><p><strong>For Windows:</strong></p><ul><li>64-bit Windows 10 or 11 .</li><li>Core 2 Duo or AMD equivalent with SSE2 technology or better.</li><li>4GB of ram with a strong recommendation for 6GB or more.</li><li>8GB of free hard drive space.</li><li>A graphics card with OpenGL 3.3 or higher and Vulkan 1.1 or higher.</li><li>Monitor with 32-bit color and a resolution of 1280x1024.</li><li>Mouse or Wacom compatible (WinTab API) pen tablet.</li></ul><p><strong>For Mac:</strong></p><ul><li>Mac OSX: 10.14 or above</li><li>Everything else is the same as above.</li></ul><p>Zbrush runs the same on Windows and Mac so there is no advantage over the other and the only real elements that you need to consider is your CPU and your RAM, A faster CPU with more cores will make this program run more stable and 16GB or RAM or more will also help with stability so if your running an older computer this will still work but you may be limited to pixel count but that is true for all 3D creation software.</p><h2 id="Autodesk-Maya"><a href="#Autodesk-Maya" class="headerlink" title="Autodesk Maya"></a>Autodesk Maya</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/autodesk-maya.jpg"                      alt="autodesk maya"                ></p><p>This guide wouldn’t be complete without introducing Maya, Maya is another industry standard for modeling but also offers animation and rigging tools meaning this covers a lot more ground that some of the other 3D modeling software.</p><p>Maya is very powerful but for this guide I will only be talking about the 3D modeling creation tools as I feel other topics need their own space but that said I think it is important to mention this is a complete workflow from creation to the exportation of your movie file into Filmora ready for editing and uploading to your audience.</p><p>Again this software has a list of features that is simply too large to cover so i will highlight some useful features for your creative process.</p><ul><li>Polygon modeling lets you create 3D models based on vertexes, edges and faces.</li><li>Nurbs modeling lets you create 3d models from geometric primitives and drawn curves</li><li>Sculpting tools allows you to create organic sculpts</li><li>Subdivision workflow for better performance in higher pixel counts</li><li>Built in UV editing</li><li>Orthopedic viewport so you can check dimensions from whichever side you need</li></ul><p>Again we are only scratching the surface of what Maya can do. Maya is capable of creating hyper realistic hard surface and organic models for use within animation and also provides all the tools needed to get a perfect rendering. Again system performance is important to consider when choosing software and the minimum requirements are as follows:</p><ul><li>Windows 10 or 11, macOS x or above and linux but see website for compatibility.</li><li>64-bit Intel or AMD multi-core processor with SSE4.2, M series Mac under rosetta 2.</li><li>8GB of RAM but 16GB or more is recommended.</li><li>7GB free disk space for the install.</li><li>Three-button mouse.</li><li>Graphics card please see website for compatibility</li></ul><p>This is a paid software and can be expensive so please consider this when choosing your desired workflow but also consider that this is a complete workflow right up to importing your video file into Filmora so the price may be justified compared to multiple software. Another thing to consider is you can mostly get the desired results you want without the use of a drawing tablet cutting even more cost.</p><h2 id="3DCoat-2022"><a href="#3DCoat-2022" class="headerlink" title="3DCoat 2022"></a>3DCoat 2022</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/3-coat-2022.jpg"                      alt="3 coat 2022"                ></p><p>3DCoat was first released in 2007 and has released constant updates inline with the 3D art community needs. Being a smaller team of developers it’s quite impressive what they have achieved as this is a fully featured 3D art software capable of creating very nice detailed models. When used with the likes of Daz 3D, Keyshot or similar animation software you can easily create the animation you are planning. This is not a full workflow but it is very close to one and the team are constantly releasing updates so one day it might be. You have the ability to UV your models as well as texture, paint and sculpt all within one program and this has one of the most impressive live retopo tools around called voxel modeling mode. Key features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Easy texturing and PBR with the use of smart materials and a HDRL viewport.</li><li>Voxel sculpting with complex boolean operations and adaptive dynamic tessellation.</li><li>Classic polygonal modeling is fully supported and also supports splines and joints.</li><li>Auto-retopology with user-defined edge loops but also fast and easy manual tools.</li><li>Professional tools for creating and editing UV-sets.</li><li>Native global uniform unwrapping algorithms.</li><li>PBR and HDRL rendering for concept exporting.</li><li>Use of scripts for repetitive actions.</li><li>And many more.</li></ul><p>This is paid software but with many options to buy as well as unlimited learning period which you will have to take into consideration when you are deciding to take this in your workflow. And again another consideration is your hardware and 3DCoat is complex due to the complexity of their software , as a point of reference there website states they consider a Surface Pro as the minimal hardware needed to use there software, minimum system specs are as follows:</p><ul><li>64-Bit Windows 7&#x2F;8&#x2F;10&#x2F;11, macOS 10.13 High Sierra or higher, Linux Ubuntu 20.04+</li><li>CPU m3 1.00 GHz,</li><li>4GB RAM</li><li>Intel HD Graphics 615</li><li>This will allow painting textures up to 2K and sculpting up to 1 million triangles</li></ul><p>What makes 3DCoat a good choice is the fact they have unlimited learning allowing you to journey into sculpting without putting any money in to start and in confection with other software it is very powerful.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896541/19272" target="_top" id="1896541">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896541" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896541/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Blender"><a href="#Blender" class="headerlink" title="Blender"></a>Blender</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/blender-modeling-software.jpg"                      alt="blender modeling software"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135371/19272" target="_top" id="2135371">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135371" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135371/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>So now it’s time to talk about Blender, the Blender institute set off with one main goal in mind and that was to put powerful tools for use with 3D and CG in the hands of artists in the form of free&#x2F;open-source software. This is commendable and they have in large achieved what they set out to do, not only can you sculpt or model in Blender you can also rig and animate and add VFX to your projects.</p><p>It’s impressive to see what you can do with free software and you will be able to achieve very good results. What you miss out on in the form of automation tools and boutique brushes and toolsets this makes up for in an ever-expanding community driven tutorials and guides. With this being free it doesn’t make sense to not have this installed even if you have a different workflow due to the ability to expand with new skills that may work their way into your daily task. Key features are as follows:</p><ul><li>Render with impressive results thanks to cycles,</li><li>An extensive toolset for modeling, curves and retopology</li><li>Sculpting tools provide the power and flexibility needed in several stages of production</li><li>Designed for animation in mind</li><li>Push the boundaries of story art by drawing in a 3d environment</li><li>Powerful post FX and VFX tools like object motion tracking</li><li>Fully customisable UI and controles</li><li>Python API means every tool can be customized and scripted</li></ul><p>Blender is complex software and due to this some functions require different hardware specs but as a rule the higher the CPU speed and cores plus the more RAM you have the more you can do at any given time. With this said the minimum system requirements are as follows@</p><ul><li>Windows 8.1,10 and 11, macOS 10.13 and above and Linux supported</li><li>64-Bit quad core CPU with SSE2 support</li><li>8GB RAM</li><li>Full HD display</li><li>Mouse, trackpad or pen+tablet</li><li>Graphics card with 2GB VRAM, OpenGL 4.3 support</li></ul><p>Blender receives regular updates and is supported by community scripts and content and is becoming a new go to tool for 3D artists in all industries and backgrounds making it a real contender when picking a workflow.</p><p><strong>From Desktop to Portable</strong></p><p>There are lots of options and this list is in no way stating what you may already use is not good enough, this is just what is being used in the industry and is more accessible to a starter or someone who works from home and doesn’t want to spend thousands upfront for their software.</p><p>That being said there is more than just the desktop workflow and some people lead busy lifestyles and are always on the move. This is where I would like to introduce the portable workflow. Due to the fact the Ipad Pro is considered a must have for portable creativity and with recent releases there has never been a better time to start i will be showing Ipad compatible apps.</p><h2 id="Forger-by-Maxon"><a href="#Forger-by-Maxon" class="headerlink" title="Forger by Maxon"></a>Forger by Maxon</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/forger-by-maxon.jpg"                      alt="forger by maxon"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1528700/16446" target="_top" id="1528700">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1528700" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1528700/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Forger is released as a standalone app or part of the Maxon one. Forger gives you all the tools needed to create sculptures and models on the go which you can be proud of. Designed by artists for artists the features are quite large considering this is running on an ipad and with the seamlessness of importing and exporting to and from software such as cinema 4D this can be worked into your workflow very easily. One feature of Forger that people like to talk about is the ability to use your ipad camera and view your model in the real world using augmented reality.</p><p>Some of the key features of Forger but not limited to are as follows:</p><ul><li>Multi-resolution mesh sculpting via catmull0clark mesh subdivisions.</li><li>Volume-based quad-dominant remeshing.</li><li>Sculpt in layers.</li><li>Sculpt with a mask with the ability to clear, invert, blur, grow and shrink your masks.</li><li>Ability to close holes in existing meshes</li><li>Simple auto-generation of mesh UVs.</li><li>Symmetrical sculpting based on axis of choice</li><li>Ability to reapply symmetry to topologically symmetrical meshes.</li></ul><p>Forger is very powerful and don’t let the fact it’s on an ipad make you think it’s inferior to the bigger desktop software as this is very capable of getting the results you are looking for. It just takes a bit of researching and a different learning curve. Due to the fact it is on an ipad the system requirements are easier to achieve, minimum system requirements are as follows</p><ul><li>IOS 15 or later</li><li>Ipad pro or current model ipad</li></ul><p>A note from the developers, the more complex the model being sculpted, the more RAM required. While there is no screen size requirement, as anticipated the bigger the better when it comes to sculpting workspace.</p><h2 id="Nomad-Sculpt"><a href="#Nomad-Sculpt" class="headerlink" title="Nomad Sculpt"></a>Nomad Sculpt</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/nomad-sculpt-software.jpg"                      alt="nomad sculpt software"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105877/7443" target="_top" id="2105877">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105877" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105877/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Nomad Sculpt is another contender offering powerful tools that artists can use to sculpt outstanding models for your animations.

This is a very cool feature as you can paint on different maps directly onto your model and get the exact results you wanted, the prerequisite for this is your OBJ needs to have UV’s already applied when you import into procreate and also this is limited to only three maps as of writing this, they have started they are going to advancing this feature in upcoming updates. Procreate also allows you to use augmented reality to view your models in the real world. Compatibility is as follows:</p><ul><li>Ipad iPadOS 14.4 or later.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130885/7443" target="_top" id="2130885">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130885" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130885/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can see there are many options and these are just a few or the ever expanding list out there but hopefully this has given you a good starting point with some of the leading industry tools to gain the results you wish.
