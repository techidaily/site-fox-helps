We are experiencing back to back changes in operating system both from Microsoft and from the newly launched Apple’s Mac. The latest OS version from Mac, MacOS Sierra is out now. Everyone is so curious to install this OS in their Macbook. There are loads of new features available in the new OS. But, there are many people who may not want to try this latest version as full time so early.</p><p>Though, this is the latest version but this doesn’t necessarily mean you will have the best experience with it all the time. So, if you have decided to downgrade to the older version that is OS X EI Capitan, we have the step by step solution for you. The steps are really simple to perform. So, here is how to downgrade from Mac OS Sierra to OS X EI Capitan.</p><p>Ok, so before we start, I just want to tell you one thing that either open this article on a different device or take a print out if you are right now reading this article on the very machine that you want to downgrade.</p><p>So, there are basically three steps of the whole process:</p><ul><li>Erase MacOS Sierra</li><li>Re-install OS X EI Capitan</li><li>Restore your data through time machine</li></ul><p>We will cover each step one by one so that it becomes easy to understand to all of you. And one more thing, you need to have an internet connection for this. So, here is the first step for you.</p><h3 id="Erase-MacOS-Sierra"><a href="#Erase-MacOS-Sierra" class="headerlink" title="Erase MacOS Sierra"></a>Erase MacOS Sierra</h3><p>1. First of all connect you Mac with a strong internet connection either through Wi-Fi or you can even use Ethernet connection. Make sure the connection is stable.</p><p>2. Now click on the “Apple” icon on your desktop.</p><p>3. You will see the dropdown menu there and you need to select “Restart” from the menu.</p><p>4. Now, do this step carefully. You need to hold down the Commanr+R together as soon as you hear the start up ding and keep holding till the time your computer reboots.</p><p>5. Now click on the “Disk Utility” button under the OS X Utilities section.</p><p>6. You will get the option to continue. Click on that.</p><p>7. Select your Startup Disk from the option.</p><p>8. At the top of the window you will see Earse tab. Click on that.</p><p>9. Now, enter the manes of the file you want to delete like MacOS Sierra.</p><p>10. Also select Mac OS Extended from the list and click Erase.</p><p>Once the process is completed quit the Disk Utility section from the dropdown, shown on the upper left corner of your screen. And go back to the OS X EI Capitan segment.</p><p>So, this is the end of the first step. Now we will move on to the next step that is reinstall OS X EI Capitan.</p><h3 id="Reinstall-Os-X-EI-Capitan"><a href="#Reinstall-Os-X-EI-Capitan" class="headerlink" title="Reinstall Os X EI Capitan"></a>Reinstall Os X EI Capitan</h3><p>Now that you have erased the present version of the OS from your Mac, you would like to install an older version for sure.</p><p>1.Go to the OS X Utilities selector and click on the “Reinstall OS X” from the dropdown.</p><p>2. Here you will see the EI Capitan installation window and click on “Continue”.</p><p>Here I would like to mention something. Depending on the date of purchase of your Mac, you may download an older version of Mac OS. You can even install the one that your Mac was shipped with. But for this you have to complete the process with Internet Recovery Mode. You can install older versions like Mavericks or Yosemite. When the installation is done open the Mac App Store. And here you will see OS X EI Capitan in your purchased list, download that. The OS will install like the standard upgrade. You have to agree with licensing terms for this.</p><p>So, we are only one step farther from the whole process to be completed. Here is the final step for you.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://getlyla.pxf.io/c/5597632/1455723/15391" target="_top" id="1455723"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15391-1455723"                      border="0" alt="" width="336" height="280"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1455723/15391"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Restore-your-data-from-Time-Machine"><a href="#Restore-your-data-from-Time-Machine" class="headerlink" title="Restore your data from Time Machine"></a>Restore your data from Time Machine</h3><p>Like it is always recommended to backup your present data through Time Machine, if you have your data saved, you can use that to reinstall in the present OS that is OS X EI Capitan by following these simple steps:</p><p>1. First of all connect your Mac with internet through Wi-Fi or Ethernet.</p><p>2. Click on the “Apple” icon shown on the desktop.</p><p>3. Click on the dropdown and select Restart from the list.</p><p>4. Hold on the Command+R as soon as you hear the startup tone and hold the key till the reboot.</p><p>5. Now go to the “Restore from Time Machine Backup” in the OS X Utilities selector.</p><p>6. Click “Continue” twice and read the important information about backup before proceeding.</p><p>7. Select the Backup source where the backup data will be stored.</p><p>8. Select most recent OS X EI Capitan backup and continue.</p><p>Hah… You are done now. Your Mac will start restoring the data from Time Machine and will reboot. This may take a while depending on your system configuration. So, just sit and relax.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Video conferencing tools that link colleagues together amidst the global pandemic are another indication of what’s to come. And just as virtual places will be persistent, so will the identities of those moving through them, allowing goods and identities to move from one virtual world to another and even into our natural world with argumentative reality or virtual reality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793234/19578" target="_top" id="1793234"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793234"                      border="0" alt="" width="678" height="452"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793234/19578"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Omniverse"><a href="#Omniverse" class="headerlink" title="Omniverse"></a>Omniverse</h3><p>Omniverse is a verse that contains everything that exists, besides other things that go out of existence.

Many editors add slow-motion effects to videos or parts to create a stylish and top-notch look.</p><p>However, this effect becomes a default in the videos after adding it, and users cannot easily deactivate the setting. It can get annoying to deal with when you are trying to play a video, but it starts automatically playing in slow-motion on your video player. Thus, for most users, learning <strong>how to change slow-motion video to normal-speed Android</strong> is important.</p><p>In general, there is no built-in feature that allows Android users to change recorded video speed, like reversing slow motion. So, it would be best if you considered third-party tools in this case. Multiple options are usable in this context, and we explain some of the best ones here. Interested?

It is important to manually change the settings or adjust the video speed directly.</p><ol><li><strong>How do I record a slow-motion video on my Android phone?</strong></li></ol><p>It is possible to record videos in slow-motion on Android phones using the editor app you are using. There are no preset speed customization settings in Android smartphones for video speed. So, you have to download and use a compatible video editing app for the function.</p><ol><li><strong>How can I convert my slow-motion video to better quality?</strong></li></ol><p>You can use different tools to convert a slow-motion video to a higher speed. The best software for that is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, with strong and multi-level video editing functions.

In a new video, Microsoft wishes to remind users that a superior alternative to Windows Movie Maker is called Clipchamp. However, the demise of the 19-year-old program opened the door for alternative <strong>movie maker windows 11</strong>, which is included with Windows 11.</p><p>The corporation reportedly acquired the editing suite Clipchamp last year, and it is reportedly accessible as an “inbox” app for Windows 11. It will therefore be pre-installed alongside other applications like Microsoft Family. In Windows 11, Clipchamp is intended to take the place of Windows Movie Maker as a video editing program. A recognizable user interface, including templates, project bins, timeline, and more, is provided by Clipchamp for <strong>Windows movie maker 11</strong>. Styles, stock media, transitions and. Filters are all included in the asset libraries that are supplied.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Use-Clipchamp-Video-Maker"><a href="#Part-1-Use-Clipchamp-Video-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

In Windows 10 and Windows 11, you may create videos using the new program Clipchamp. The editing program Clipchamp, which Microsoft purchased last year, is superior to earlier programs like Windows Movie Maker. For work, social networking, or to document significant occasions, you may use Clipchamp on Windows to produce intriguing new films.

Edit Videos in Windows 11 with Photos App<p>Windows has always offered methods for searching and displaying photos because it is a relatively flexible operating system.

The company has been producing high-quality aerial photography drones over the last few years and the first blade 350QX was released just two years ago. Since that time Horizon Hobby has produced several new versions of the Blade and the Chroma is the first one to enable the use of a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Although the 4k version is not the standard version of the Chroma, it is one of the newest and best available in their line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blade-chroma-quadcopter-drone.jpg"                      alt="blade chroma 4k"                ></p><p> The staple of this configuration is a performance drawn that also includes a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3-axis gimbal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and mount that is designed to use a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The Chroma 4k quad copter comes with a CGO3 4k camera or a CGO2+ camera capable of shooting in 1080p. The device can also come with a gimbal made for a GoPro which can be bought separately. The idea of including the attachment for a GoPro is to have a performance drawn that’s capable of competing with the GoPro Karma line by using the same quality camera.</p><h2 id="Pros-and-cons-of-Blade-Chroma"><a href="#Pros-and-cons-of-Blade-Chroma" class="headerlink" title="Pros and cons of Blade Chroma"></a>Pros and cons of Blade Chroma</h2><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><ol><li>One of the best parts of using this style of drone is that it comes with a wealth of repair parts and a fantastic range for both the battery as well as for control. Horizon Hobby has always been known for producing performance drones as well as offering some of the best customer service in the market. You will always be able to find parts for this drone as well as instructions on how to repair it and this can really improve the longevity of the device.</li><li>The camera that comes with this drone is also fairly competitive. Although it may not be able to compete with the latest go pro models, it can deliver close to the same image quality with a fair resiliency in several different types of weather.</li><li>The device has some of the best battery life out of any quad copter on the market currently with a flight time rated at up to 30 min.<br> <strong>Cons:</strong></li><li>One of the drawbacks to using this device firstly is that this may not be a drone that you can afford a second battery for. Because the developers used such a large battery to improve flight time, a secondary battery will cost you several hundred dollars.</li><li>Flight times also begin to drop off considerably especially when recording in 4K. Although the replacement parts are easy to source they also grow quite expensive due to the high quality performance of this drone.</li><li>Unlike some other drones in the same price point this one also doesn’t feature anything like GPS Waypoint or some of the collision detection and control features that can be found on similar drones in the price point.<br><strong>Verdict</strong></li></ol><p> Overall this device is fairly easy to use and the camera can be fairly good when compared to other 4K experiences in the same price point. If you are a beginner with drones or you are looking for a device that can fly with autonomous GPS precision, this may not be the right drone for you to pick however. Pilots that want full control at all times are going to enjoy the performance of this drone however.</p><h2 id="Complete-Review-for-Blade-Chroma-Drone"><a href="#Complete-Review-for-Blade-Chroma-Drone" class="headerlink" title="Complete Review for Blade Chroma Drone"></a>Complete Review for Blade Chroma Drone</h2><p> With a drone that’s designed to be extremely versatile and balanced, the Chroma line of drones is designed for his resiliency and it really resembles the look of a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Yuneec Typhoon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> style quad copter. The battery is extremely light weight but also quite powerful and this can improve the speed and performance of the drone while maximizing its weight balanced. The stabilization on this drone for image quality is quite easy to predict and this can be helpful on a drone especially when there is very little in the way of GPS waypoint.</p><h4 id="1-Battery"><a href="#1-Battery" class="headerlink" title="1.  Battery"></a>1.  Battery</h4><p> The battery life on this drone is fairly decent. The 6300mAH battery is one of the largest available on a quad copter today. It takes just under two hours to charge but the replacement batteries are additional batteries can get quite expensive at $120 each minimum. The three cell battery does often keep this drone in flight for 25+ minutes at a time but with the prices for replacement or additional batteries, you may find yourself charging it often.</p><h4 id="2-Flight-Performance"><a href="#2-Flight-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.  Flight Performance"></a>2.  Flight Performance</h4><p> There are several different flight modes including Smart Mode, Aerial Photography Mode, Follow Me&#x2F;Tracking Mode as well as Return to Home Mode:</p><p> Smart mode is made for beginners while the AP mode is best for the more experienced pilots. The Follow Me mode allows you to focus on lining up the perfect shot as the drone follows you from a distance you preset. Tracking Mode makes the quadcopter follow and keeps the camera focused on whoever is carrying the controller, and the Return Home feature ensures safe landings with just one flip of a switch.</p><h4 id="3-Controller"><a href="#3-Controller" class="headerlink" title="3.  Controller"></a>3.  Controller</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blade-chroma-4k-controller.jpg"                      alt="blade chroma 4k controller"                ></p><p> ST10+ controller has a built-in 5.5-inch touchscreen display to deliver a live view from the camera, making it easy to see how much battery life has been used, how fast the drone is flying as well as other flight information. There’s a little bit of lag between the camera and screen, and the screen lacks the brightness control which makes it hard to observe the info when you are outside on a sunny day.</p><h4 id="4-Camera"><a href="#4-Camera" class="headerlink" title="4.  Camera"></a>4.  Camera</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blade-chroma-4k-camera.jpg"                      alt="blade chroma 4k camera"                ></p><p> The camera can produce some fairly decent images the UHD quality is great with 4K at 30 frames per second. If you want to get the most out of zoomed shots however, the images on this drone can start to show a bit of rough edges. It’s not great in darker conditions or with shadows especially when compared to the GoPro as well.</p><p> Overall this drone is a lot of fun to fly and it can shoot excellent quality video with the chance to change out the camera for a GoPro if possible. The device is also known for its agility as well as its stability. Although you can’t set GPS flight pattern areas, there are economist modes as well as safeguards which can prevent the drone from crashing into obstacles. This drone is something that’s usually recommended for more experienced pilots but for its base price it can be a lot of fun to use with quality performance and flight time. Professionals will definitely want to upgrade to the 4k camera or use a different camera from the base model however.</p><p><img                       lazyload

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Bright-Futures-in-Film-Revolutionary-Setup-Tips"><a href="#Bright-Futures-in-Film-Revolutionary-Setup-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Bright Futures in Film: Revolutionary Setup Tips"></a>Bright Futures in Film: Revolutionary Setup Tips</h2><p>Many people are wondering how to set up lighting for video shooting. While there are many different ways to set up lighting, some methods are more effective than others.</p><p>Therefore, this article will give you a complete guide on how to set up your lighting to make your videos stand out.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Guide"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How-to Guide"></a>Part 1. How-to Guide</h2><p><strong><em>1) Preparation</em></strong></p><p>Before we get started, you may need to prepare some things to set up your lighting:</p><p><strong>1. Powerful LED Lights</strong></p><p>LED lights are a huge step up from traditional incandescent lighting because they generate much less heat and energy. Also, you can change the color temperature and use different lighting effects.</p><p><strong>2. Softbox</strong></p><p>Softbox can help you diffuse and spread the light on the subject.</p><p><strong>3. Fresnel lens</strong></p><p>A Fresnel lens is an optional attachment that can bounce the light off of the ceiling of your studio and diffuses the light to look soft.</p><p><strong><em>2) Steps</em></strong></p><p>For this tutorial, we will use the Three-Point Lighting technique:</p><h5 id="Step1-Set-the-Key-Light"><a href="#Step1-Set-the-Key-Light" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Set the Key Light"></a>Step1 Set the Key Light</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-1.jpg"                      alt="set the key light"                ></p><p>The key light is the main light that illuminates the subject. You can place it in the front and slightly to one side. For this key light, we use an LED called Aputure 300X as an example, and with a soft box called light Dome 2.</p><h5 id="Step2-Set-the-Fill-Light"><a href="#Step2-Set-the-Fill-Light" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Set the Fill Light"></a>Step2 Set the Fill Light</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-2.jpg"                      alt="set the fill light"                ></p><p>The fill light is used to fill in the shadows created by the key light. It is usually placed on the opposite side of the subject. For the fill light, we use an Aputure 300D with a fresnel lens attachment.</p><h5 id="Step3-Set-the-Backlight"><a href="#Step3-Set-the-Backlight" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Set the Backlight"></a>Step3 Set the Backlight</h5><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-3.jpg"                      alt="set the backlight"                ></p><p>For this tutorial, we use Aperture 120d as the backlight and lift it up into the air with a c-stand so it can light the subject from above. It helps to separate the talent from the background and give the audience a full view of the set</p><h5 id="Step4-Use-Practical-Lights"><a href="#Step4-Use-Practical-Lights" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Use Practical Lights"></a>Step4 Use Practical Lights</h5><p>Practical lights appear on the camera to add some visual flair. It can be any light source that isn’t meant for lighting the subject. For example, we use a green lamp to help our background pop as it casts a nice orange light on the back wall.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-4.jpg"                      alt="use practical lights"                ></p><p>Then, we also have a LED ring light that shines toward the camera. The light adds even more light to the frame and gives a slight backlight to the subject.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-5.jpg"                      alt="led ring light"                ></p><p>Finally, we have a few other small LED lights like this unicorn to put in the background. This lighting helps us to get even more visual flair out of our shots.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-6.jpg"                      alt="other small led lights"                ></p><p>After setting up all the lighting above, you can take a look at the comparison below:</p><p><strong>Using Key Light only</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-7.jpg"                      alt="using key light only"                ></p><p><strong>Using Key Light + Fill + Backlight</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-8.jpg"                      alt="using key light + fill + backlight"                ></p><p><strong><em>3) Pro Tips: The light setting</em></strong></p><p>We usually set the lights around 50% brightness and a color temperature of 5600K.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/make-videos-stand-out-9.jpg"                      alt="the light setting"                ></p><h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Hopefully, you learned something about lighting by taking a look at our setup.

That’s why many filmmakers, editors, and colorists working on film use Look Up Tables, or LUTs, to store color grades as templates to help speed up the process.</p><p>We’re letting you know that you don’t have to work on the film to use LUTs to help personalize and mark your videos. If you’re wondering how you can get started with color grading to speed up your workflow and create better-looking shots for your business, we’ve got you covered.</p><p><strong>LUTs in Movies</strong></p><p>Various LUT types are employed during post-production for color grading and color correction.</p><p>First, the two LUT formats work differently. <strong>A 1D LUT</strong> (usually. lut format) controls a single parameter, generally gamma. A 1D LUT takes a sort of blanket approach; the adjustment applies to everything in the image without much flexibility. One parameter affects all colors, saturations, and contrast. <strong>A 3D LUT</strong> (usually a. cube format) has three axes that independently adjust Hue, Saturation, Luminance, Gamma, and Contrast and can change as conditions in the image change. As such, a 3D LUT is much more flexible and powerful and is the only way to achieve a truly cinematic color grade with LUT.</p><p>The other two types of LUTs can be either 1D or 3D LUTs, but these days they are most often 3D LUTs. The difference between them is when in the process you use them and for what purpose.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-central-3.jpg"                      alt="luts in movies"                ></p><p>An input or camera LUT used at the beginning of the color correction process adjusts the footage so that the color correction tools work correctly. Color corrected recordings that require an input or camera LUT without one can lead to unexpected and unsatisfactory results.</p><p>Conversely, you typically apply a LUT look after you’ve done color correction and moved on to the color grading phase. Use it to dial in the exact artistic look you want. The Look LUT contains instructions to create a predetermined desired look for your shots, which can be an incredible time saver in the color grading process.</p><p>Always colorize an appearance LUT correctly before applying it, as appearance LUTs assume an underlying natural color. If you don’t, you may not see the results that the LUT is supposed to give you.</p><p>LUTs are specially designed for different recording types – LOG, RAW, Rec.709, Rec.2020, HDR, and more. You can apply any LUT to any footage, but if you apply a LUT designed for a specific type of footage to another type, you can end up with a very different look than what you expected. But then it can also give you a result you like, so you are free to experiment as you wish. LUTs are non-destructive, so you can load and delete them at will.</p><p>Many camera manufacturers, software companies, and independent producers offer downloadable LUTs or LUT packs. They often design these skins for specific purposes, such as color correcting footage captured by their cameras or to mimic signature skins seen in movies and TV shows.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Innovating-with-Snapchat’s-New-Highlight-Feature"><a href="#Innovating-with-Snapchat’s-New-Highlight-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Innovating with Snapchat’s New Highlight Feature"></a>Innovating with Snapchat’s New Highlight Feature</h2><p>Snapchat is one of the most popular instant messaging apps. The key feature that makes it different from other messaging apps is that users can send text messages, pictures, and short videos that disappear after they are viewed.</p><p>Over the years, Snapchat has introduced various features that elevated its status from being an instant messaging app to a social media platform. In November 2020, Snapchat rolled out a new feature called Spotlight that has become a massive hit among users.</p><p>The Spotlight feature aims to make Snapchat compete with TikTok and Instagram Reels. As you may have guessed now, Spotlight is a collection of the most entertaining videos posted by app users.</p><p>Whether you want to post your videos on Snapchat Spotlight or want to know more about them, you just need to go through this article.</p><h2 id="What-Exactly-is-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#What-Exactly-is-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?"></a>What Exactly is Snapchat Spotlight?</h2><p>Snapchat introduced Spotlight as a whole new section in its app that features several engaging short videos, also known as Snaps. The maximum duration of a video can be up to 1 minute or 60 seconds. Content creators must submit their videos to Spotlight so that moderators can review them and decide if they are worthy of featuring in the Spotlight section.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the intention of adding the Spotlight feature in Snapchat is to engage users through short-form user videos, just like TikTok. After the massive popularity gained by TikTok in 2020, many platforms tried following the same path to glory, including Snapchat and Instagram.</p><h3 id="Snapchat-Spotlight-vs-TikTok-Main-Differences"><a href="#Snapchat-Spotlight-vs-TikTok-Main-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences"></a>Snapchat Spotlight vs TikTok: Main Differences</h3><p>When comparing Snapchat and TikTok, there are specific differences that you can quickly notice. Let’s discuss those differences below:</p><p><strong>● Comments Sections</strong></p><p>While watching short-form videos on TikTok, you can leave your thoughts in the comments. However, you get no such comments section in the Snapchat Spotlight.</p><p><strong>● Privacy Protection</strong></p><p>If we talk about TikTok, you can view the display name of the content creator for each video. On the other hand, Snapchat enforces a strict privacy protection mechanism that hides the display name of creators if they are under 18. However, there’s an option to use a public profile if users below 18 wish to make their display name available to viewers.</p><h3 id="Guidelines-for-Submitting-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#Guidelines-for-Submitting-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight"></a>Guidelines for Submitting Snapchat Spotlight</h3><p>It’s easy to submit snaps (short-form videos) on Snapchat Spotlight. However, it is essential to ensure that your videos adhere to specific guidelines set by Snapchat. This section aims to make you familiar with them.</p><p><strong>Video Requirements</strong></p><p>The snaps that you want to submit to Spotlight should meet the following technical requirements:</p><ul><li>The minimum duration of a snap is 5 seconds, while the maximum is 60 seconds.</li><li>The video should be in portrait orientation.</li><li>The minimum aspect ratio of a snap is 3:4.</li><li>The horizontal resolution of a snap must be at least 640 px.</li><li>There shouldn’t be any logo in the snap.</li><li>The content of the snap should cover the complete frame.</li></ul><p>If your snap doesn’t meet the above-mentioned requirements, it will become ineligible for getting featured on Spotlight.</p><p><strong>Submission Terms</strong></p><p>There are certain community guidelines that apply to all Spotlight snaps. These guidelines ensure that the snaps within Spotlight entertain people without hurting their sentiments in any way.</p><p>While posting a snap on Spotlight, you need to avoid content that contains the following:</p><ul><li>Sexual acts</li><li>Harassment and bullying</li><li>Threats, violence, or harm</li><li>Illegal activities</li><li>Terrorism and hate speech</li></ul><p>You can go through the official <a class="link"   href="https://snap.com/en-US/community-guidelines" >Snapchat community guidelines <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to learn more.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Snapchat-Spotlight"><a href="#How-to-Use-Snapchat-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?"></a>How to Use Snapchat Spotlight?</h2><p>Snapchat Spotlight is relatively easy to use, especially if you are familiar with YouTube Shorts and TikTok. If you want to submit snaps to Spotlight, you will be happy to know that the whole process is quick and straightforward. The only thing that will consume a significant time is the snap creation itself.</p><p>If you already have a video or a snap idea that can make it to Spotlight, you need to know the steps for submitting a snap to Spotlight. We will discuss them in the next section.</p><h3 id="How-to-Post-on-Spotlight"><a href="#How-to-Post-on-Spotlight" class="headerlink" title="How to Post on Spotlight?"></a>How to Post on Spotlight?</h3><p>There are multiple methods to submit a snap to Spotlight. For example, you can create a new snap using the phone’s camera or advance an existing video from your gallery. Also, Snapchat lets you submit a snap to Spotlight from a desktop using a web browser.</p><p>Let’s discuss each method one by one below.</p><p><strong>From Phone</strong></p><p>Step1 Launch the Snapchat app on your phone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-post-on-spotlight-from-phone-1.jpg"                      alt="open snapchat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://checkout.mirillis.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4704640&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/547a5a56d43f6d40f9a6a2f76501d013/products/1_mirillis_action_boxshot_store_1x.jpg"                      border="0"                ><br>    Home Use license is dedicated for personal, non-commercial use only.<br>    If Action! is used for commercial gain or to further any commercial purpose,<br>    a Commercial Use license is required.

The algorithm decides what snaps to show to a particular user based on their interests and other factors.</p><p>The following are the key factors that the Spotlight algorithm considers for showing users the most relevant and exciting snaps.</p><p><strong>Unique Views</strong></p><p>A unique view means a user viewed a snap at least once in a single session. If a user views a snap multiple times in a single session, it will still be considered a unique view.</p><p><strong>Total View Time</strong></p><p>It represents the total time that users have spent watching a snap. If a user watches a single snap multiple times, the duration of each individual view will be added to the total view time.</p><p><strong>Number of Times the Video was Shared</strong></p><p>It represents the total number of times Snapchat users shared a particular snap with others.</p><p><strong>Number of Screenshots</strong></p><p>This factor considers the total number of times a screenshot was taken of a snap by a user.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=37701530&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6fe0c81e3f9438db11ebbfba6c5ce460/products/copy_cbLogo_with_text_blue.png"                      border="0"                >CalendarBudget - Monthly subscription membership to CalendarBudget via web browser or mobile app. Support included. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Quick-Tips-to-Build-Your-Snapchat-Community"><a href="#Quick-Tips-to-Build-Your-Snapchat-Community" class="headerlink" title="Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community"></a>Quick Tips to Build Your Snapchat Community</h3><p>Your Snapchat community is your audience who loves to watch and interact with your snaps. Building a Snapchat community means growing your audience by delivering genuine, entertaining, and engaging content.</p><p>Here are some tips that can help you build a Snapchat community.</p><p><strong>Choose a Niche</strong></p><p>Uploading random snaps will not earn you a loyal audience on Spotlight. So, you need to pick a specific niche, such as gaming, pranks, and comedy, to target a particular audience with your snaps.</p><p><strong>Use Snapchat’s Built-in Creative Tools</strong></p><p>Snapchat provides several tools to help you become more creative with your snaps. Using those creative tools is good as the Spotlight algorithm pretends to prioritize videos edited with Snapchat’s native tools.</p><p><strong>Stay Consistent</strong></p><p>It is challenging to post snaps consistently, especially if you are just starting. However, maintaining consistency with your Snaps will help you earn more audience.</p><h2 id="A-Bonus-Tip-A-Great-Video-Editor-Facilitates-Your-Snapchat-Creating-Journey"><a href="#A-Bonus-Tip-A-Great-Video-Editor-Facilitates-Your-Snapchat-Creating-Journey" class="headerlink" title="A Bonus Tip: A Great Video Editor Facilitates Your Snapchat Creating Journey"></a>A Bonus Tip: A Great Video Editor Facilitates Your Snapchat Creating Journey</h2><p>Hopefully, you have known how to use Snapchat Spotlight and been ready to plan your creator life.

However, a beginner frequently doesn’t know where to start when attempting color correction and color mixing for the first time. Color rings and color curves seem to be professional-level tools that are far beyond their reach.

You may also find that longer boomerang videos lose their effect after a while and therefore we recommend sticking to shorter looped videos that are much easier to share online, particularly on social media platforms.</p><p>**<strong>Can You Make a Boomerang Video Using an Exiting Video?</strong></p><p>Yes. Most solutions allow you to use an exciting video to create a boomerang video. But it is important to note that sometimes you may want to shoot a video that you can then use to create a boomerang video and therefore you should choose a tool that will allow you to do both. It is also worth pointing out that some tools are easier to use than others and you want to pick a solution that simplifies the process.</p><p>**<strong>What is the Best Way to Make a Boomerang Video?</strong></p><p>The best tool that you can use to create a boomerang video for any purpose is Wondershare Filmora. This is because not only will you easily loop the video to create the boomerang effect, but you can also use its numerous effects and features to embellish the video as much as you want. Since you can export the video in numerous different formats, it can be used to create videos for all sorts of purposes.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If you have long admired the boomerang videos that you see on social media and have been wondering how they are made, now you have four different ways to create your own and share them on social media.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p>Once the app is installed, open it on your computer.</p><p><strong><em>Step 2: Import the Video into the Timeline</em></strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/filmora-split-button.jpg"                      alt="drag video to timeline"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://thefitville.pxf.io/c/5597632/1526796/15852" target="_top" id="1526796"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/15852-1526796"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="628"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1526796/15852"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Drag and drop the video that you want to use into the main window of Filmora to open it and it will also appear in the timeline.</p><p><strong><em>Step 3: Select a section to Loop</em></strong></p><p>In the timeline, choose a section of the video that you want to loop and use the “Cut” tool to cut this section of the video from the rest of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/split-video-icon-filmora.jpg"                      alt="select section video"                ></p><p>Then right-click on the clip in the timeline and choose “copy” to create a copy of the clip.</p><p>Place the cursor on the timeline again and right-click to choose “Paste.”</p><p><strong><em>Step 4: Create Your Boomerang Effect</em></strong></p><p>Click on this second clip that you just created and go to “Video” and check the box marked “plat video clip in reverse.”</p><p>You now have a boomerang video and you can use the numerous effects in Filmora to customize it in numerous ways.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://purchase.swifdoo.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38709260&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8b932759a5a04ddb34bf79e3f9072e4b/products/Product%20box%20white-1024x1024.png"                      border="0"                >SwifDoo PDF Perpetual (2-PC)  Free upgrade. No monthly fees ever. </a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Boomerang-Video-on-iPhone-1"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Boomerang-Video-on-iPhone-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Boomerang Video on iPhone"></a>How to Make a Boomerang Video on iPhone</h2><p>You can easily make a boomerang video on your iPhone using the Boomerang app or using Instagram.

It is a sequence of photos stitched together to create a movie or video where time seems to pass extremely fast. For instance, wilting and blooming for the flow only in a 10-second video. You might have seen numerous <strong>Canon time-lapse</strong>s and always wanted to create one.</p><p>If you want to take the challenge and create something magical like this with your Canon camera, you have come to the right place. Here we will tell you everything from how to shoot to editing time-lapse videos. You will also get some tips for time-lapse recording video so let’s start with this article.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Time-lapse-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Time-lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Time-lapse Video?"></a>Part 1. What is Time-lapse Video?</h2><p>Time-lapse video is considered a technique of cinematography where a photographer takes a series of images in the same frame at several intervals for a certain period and rapidly plays it for the entire time. For instance:- Separate shots of a flower blooming over time becomes a video of growing a flower from seedling to bloom.</p><p>So what’s the purpose of it? Here is the purpose of creating an illusion of extreme speed movement by manipulating the time. It seems like the object is rushing at a fast pace. This cinematography technique is mainly used for capturing prolonged processes that will become exciting and visible if it is watched with the human eye.</p><p>The time-lapse is even used to capture swift movement, showing it faster. This article will explore how time-lapse on canon 6d is made. In simple words, time-lapse is a process of shooting for an extended period and then editing in fast motion to make it enjoyable. Let’s see how it is done.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-Canon-Camera"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-Canon-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with Canon Camera?"></a>Part 2. How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with Canon Camera?</h2><p>Let’s explore the time-lapse world in the comfort of your home or when you are chilling out with your family and friends. You can use your Canon 70d time-lapse to do it better. The time-lapse is an innovative technique that allows you to reveal a hidden world on the move, and it will produce some magical and surprising results. Let’s check out the steps of hooting time-lapse video with a Canon camera.</p><p><strong>1:-</strong> Change your Canon camera settings to the Time-lapse movie by tapping on the menu and searching Timelapse Movie mode in your menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-time-lapse-canon-camera.jpg"                      alt="enable time lapse on canon"                ></p><p><strong>2:-</strong> Tap on the info button to access the setting for the interval time and the no. of shots.</p><p><strong>3:-</strong> You can choose the interval number to determine your camera’s frequency, which means once every second or twice a minute. The interval time will depend on the subject. Recording a slow-moving object like blossoming flowers or drifting clouds will take more time between the shots and vice versa.</p><p><strong>4:-</strong> Put the number of shots you want your camera to take. According to the interval and number of shots, your Canon 80d time-lapse will tell you the number of footage you have to take to end the video. There is a general thumb rule for recording time-lapse videos, and you will need around 24-25 images for each second of your video.</p><p><strong>5:-</strong> Compose the shot and tap on the shutter button. While shooting the time-lapse video, it is recommended that you should place the camera on a tripod to maintain the composition of duration. Also, after you are happy with the composition and settings, you can tap the shutter button and allow your camera to show its magic.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296685&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="http://cdnwww.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2022/video-pp/ScreenshotSlider/Nero-Video-Advanced-editing.JPG"                      border="0"                >Simple and intuitive video editing<br>🎬 Nero Video:<br>The powerful video editing program for your Windows PC</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips"><a href="#Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Canon Time Lapse Video Shooting Tips"></a>Part 3. Canon Time Lapse Video Shooting Tips</h2><p><strong>Never forget to take test shots:-</strong> You must never start shooting straight away. Also, you can take some random test shots. This ensures you get the best composition and angle you are looking for.</p><p><strong>Always take photos in JPG:-</strong> Set the Canon Camera to capture pictures in the best JPG quality, or else you can run out of space quickly.</p><p><strong>Use manual mode:-</strong> It’s recommended to shoot in manual mode, and you must shoot with the manual white balance, exposure, aperture, and shutter speed. Moreover, it will help you to avoid auto-adjusting your camera.</p><p><strong>Carry extra batteries:-</strong> If you want to create a time-lapse video outdoors, you must carry extra batteries. Also, it is good if the camera battery is changed before your camera gets shut down. If you are shooting time-lapse video indoors, it’s better to use the main charger. Also, it will help you avoid excess battery draining.</p><p><strong>Carry Extra Memory cards:-</strong> You will never want to run out of space while making a time-lapse, and you will have to make the calculations according to your time-lapse. Also, make sure you carry the extra memory cards to be prepared.</p><p><strong>Choose the best spot:-</strong> Set your tripod securely and in a place where it cannot be knocked or moved quickly.</p><p><strong>Focus on the camera:-</strong> Always ensure that the equipment and camera are in sight while you are shooting and safe.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Extra-How-to-Edit-Timelapse-Video-on-Computer"><a href="#Part-4-Extra-How-to-Edit-Timelapse-Video-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Extra: How to Edit Timelapse Video on Computer</h2><p>We all love time-lapse videos; be it sunset, busy traffic movement, or cloud movement, we always wonder how they are made. Also, it is an excellent technique mainly used to create highly fast-paced videos by creating a time illusion. Moreover, time-lapse videos are primarily used to capture highly slow-paced subjects. They take a lot of time to record, like flower blooming, sunset, or sunrise.</p><p>However, to make it presentable and exciting to the viewers, time-lapse is used. You can use Filmora to edit your time-lapse videos and make them more presentable for your social media. Also, you will be surprised that Filmora offers more than 100 free filters.
