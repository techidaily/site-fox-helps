For example, regardless of the source, you cannot use someone’s street art in your commercial campaigns without their consent. In addition, different artists offer their work under various licenses, each with its unique usage requirements. For example, artwork under the Creative Commons license is free to use for personal and commercial purposes.</p><p>However, not all platforms offer the license information freely. Therefore, here is some information to help you identify royalty-free art you can use for your creative projects.</p><h3 id="So-what-are-public-domain-arts"><a href="#So-what-are-public-domain-arts" class="headerlink" title="So, what are public domain arts?"></a>So, what are public domain arts?</h3><p>Public domain arts are any creation out of copyright, meaning you can use it hassle-free. In addition, public domain arts span various creations, including graffiti, video mash-ups, songs, images, and paintings. Furthermore, most government copyright offices do not list public domain arts on their websites.</p><p>However, the following are the determining factors for work to become public domain.</p><p><strong>The copyright protection is expired</strong></p><p>Any work between 50 and 70 years old after the author’s death is public domain art. However, the copyright expiry can vary between countries. Therefore, familiarize yourself with your country’s copyright policy before using such works.</p><p><strong>The art does not meet the requirements for copyright protection</strong></p><p>In many countries, recipes, facts, and calendar dates do not qualify for copyright protection. However, you can face legal action if they include original descriptions and artwork. For example, reposting the images from last year’s calendar is a violation if a professional photographer does them.</p><p>In addition, some countries do not consider government documents as copyright items. For example, planet photos and videos from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration are <a class="link"   href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/index.html" >public domain art <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, meaning you can use them freely for commercial and personal creations.</p><h3 id="What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history"><a href="#What-is-the-copyright-policy-of-famous-art-in-history" class="headerlink" title="What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?"></a>What is the copyright policy of famous art in history?</h3><p>As mentioned above, you cannot rely on copyright websites to determine if your desired art is royalty-free, especially when the artist’s work is unpublished. However, the following tips can be useful in helping you avoid copyright violations. Kindly note that the tips below are for your general knowledge, and you should not rely on them as legal expert advice.</p><ol><li>All work published before January 1st, 1923 is public domain art. However, famous art between 75 and 100 years old may have copyright extensions, which can affect their usage in other projects. Therefore, you should check with the current owner to determine whether they are royalty-free art.</li><li>You can freely use your photo of famous paintings, drawings, and sculptures if they are an exact reproduction of the public domain artwork. This is because you automatically earn the copyright since the photo includes elements of your originality, such as the camera angle and post-production techniques.</li><li>You can not use a third-party photo of public domain art if the resulting image is a derivative. This is because the law recognizes the creator as the author and copyright owner. As such, you must have verifiable permission before using their work in your creations.</li><li>Not all items without a © are in the public domain. This is because modern video editing software allows you to remove copyright symbols from different works. Therefore, always perform a reverse image search when unsure of the photo’s origins.</li></ol><h3 id="Can-you-use-them-for-free"><a href="#Can-you-use-them-for-free" class="headerlink" title="Can you use them for free?"></a>Can you use them for free?</h3><p>Yes. You can use royalty-free art for whatever purpose you see fit. For example, you can reproduce the text and illustrations from the original version of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) because they are in the public domain.</p><p>However, the reproduction of the 1951 version by Walt Disney is a copyright violation since it is a derivative of the original version. In addition, The Walt Disney Company owns the trademark for all the derivatives, including the movie, cartoon characters, and merchandise.</p><h2 id="Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations"><a href="#Part2-Best-Official-Public-Domain-Art-websites-recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations"></a>Part2: Best Official Public Domain Art websites recommendations</h2><p>Now that you know what constitutes being in the public domain, where can you find public domain creative assets? Below are recommendations of the best official public domain art websites. Kindly note that the list contains NGO and government sites, some of which may not be accessible in your area.</p><h3 id="1-Public-Domain-Pictures"><a href="#1-Public-Domain-Pictures" class="headerlink" title="1.

In addition, you can easily identify your desired pictures using the categories tab. However, you need to purchase the Premium Download option if you want them in larger resolutions. Furthermore, some royalty-free art may include usage restrictions, which are clearly stated in the image description. For example, you cannot use photos with paid models for offensive campaigns.</p><h3 id="2-Wikimedia-Commons"><a href="#2-Wikimedia-Commons" class="headerlink" title="2. Wikimedia Commons "></a>2.

In addition, it allows you to only search public domain items by checking the option on the search box.</p><p>Furthermore, the homepage contains different photo collections, which you can access by clicking the category tabs. For example, the <strong>recently digitized</strong> bubble tab gives you access to the most recent photo uploads. However, not all images listed are free to use and may require you to link back to the website. As such, always read the <strong>Rights Statement</strong> at the bottom of the download page to verify the usage requirements.</p><h3 id="4-Flickr-Commons"><a href="#4-Flickr-Commons" class="headerlink" title="4.

However, through their partnership with the Library of Congress in 2008, you can now access thousands of public domain historical photos from institutions like UC Berkeley and the Armenian Studies Program - Fresno State.</p><p>In addition, most of the photos on the Flickr Commons library are listed with <strong>no known copyright restrictions</strong>. Therefore, you can download and use them without fear of any repercussions. Furthermore, the search engine includes multiple filters for more accurate results. For example, you can filter photos by color, orientation, and date.

The platform allows you to search millions of public domain images from some of the world’s top museums, including the Smithsonian and the Met.</p><p>In addition, Artvee.com offers you keyword suggestions depending on user popularity. Alternatively, you can use the Artists tab to locate classical art by specific painters, including Claude Monet and Vincent Van Gogh. Furthermore, you do not need to register an account to use the service. You only need to enter the URL in your browser, narrow down the results using keywords and click download.</p><h3 id="2-Museo"><a href="#2-Museo" class="headerlink" title="2. Museo "></a>2.

Currently, you can access the collections from the following institutions:</p><ul><li>The Harvard Art Museums.</li><li>The Rijksmuseum</li><li>The Art Institute of Chicago.</li><li>The Cleveland Museum of Art.</li><li>The Minneapolis Institute of Art.</li><li>The New York Public Library Collection.</li></ul><p>The above institutions offer open and free API access to their collections, allowing you to download and use them royalty-free. Unfortunately, Museo does not offer an elaborate search engine like Artvee and uses simple keywords to get you results.

A resize option will appear to click on it and make the changes you want to your picture.</p><p><strong>Additional and Modification of Filters:</strong> once you are in editing mode, you can add any filter from the pool of beautiful filters available on the photo editor app. The filter button is next to the crop button, click on it and choose any filter you want.

A little over 50% of those users don’t have Spotify premium. This means they will be exposed to ads. So, you have a potential audience of over 200 million people.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://headphonesaddict.com/listening-to-music-statistics/" >23% of all recorded users <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> use a streaming service like Spotify to listen to music. This is the highest percentage compared to all other methods of listening to music. The most common devices used are a car’s radio and smartphones.</p><p>Additionally, Spotify’s ads system is quite effective. Most of their free-plan users expect to hear ads. Therefore, they are prepared and will listen through the entire ad while focusing on the message.</p><p>These are more than enough reasons to understand the potential of Spotify ads.</p><p>Also, did you know that you can create several ads on Spotify that differ significantly? Yes, there are four significant types of Spotify ads.</p><h2 id="4-Main-Types-of-Spotify-Ads-How-to-Choose-the-Best-One"><a href="#4-Main-Types-of-Spotify-Ads-How-to-Choose-the-Best-One" class="headerlink" title="4 Main Types of Spotify Ads (How to Choose the Best One)"></a>4 Main Types of Spotify Ads (How to Choose the Best One)</h2><p>We already discussed the incredible potential and exposure ads on Spotify can bring. Now, it’s time to find out what type of ad will be ideal in your case.</p><h3 id="Audio-Ads"><a href="#Audio-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Audio Ads"></a>Audio Ads</h3><p>Any guide to Spotify ads will tell you that their audio ads are the easiest to create. Anyone can make them. You must record a 15-30 second audio clip sharing your message.</p><p>Spotify’s Ad Studio offers fantastic tools to help you create your ads. You may also place a creative image on the ad with a link straight to your landing page, website, or offer.</p><p>The idea is to make this a straightforward process that makes the listener want to click.</p><p>Spotify is accurate at predicting when the user is most receptive. That’s when it will play your audio ad.</p><h3 id="Spotify-Video-Ads"><a href="#Spotify-Video-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Spotify Video Ads"></a>Spotify Video Ads</h3><p>Video ads on Spotify are 15 to 30-second clips that include audio and visuals to convey a message. They can be played on both Desktop and Mobile.</p><p>Spotify will display these ads when the user is actively engaged on the screen. However, it will not play them if their phone is locked and if Spotify is not active on the net.</p><p>There are two types of Spotify video ads you can use, namely video Takeover Ads and Spotify Sponsored Sessions. Choosing the one that’s right for you can significantly increase conversions.</p><p><strong>Takeover ads</strong> pop up when you’re actively going through Spotify and its music catalogues. <strong>Sponsored Sessions</strong> are video ads that let you watch them in exchange for 30 minutes of ad-free music.</p><p>Compared to Spotify audio ads, video ads offer a few advantages:</p><ul><li>Video ads play unmuted and allow for a more visual presentation of what is being advertised</li><li>They can be displayed when users are actively using the app</li><li>Each video ad can grant you the chance to use Spotify ad-free for 30 minutes per ad watched</li></ul><h3 id="Overlay-Ads-Display-Ads"><a href="#Overlay-Ads-Display-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Overlay Ads (Display Ads)"></a>Overlay Ads (Display Ads)</h3><p>These ads do not have audio or video in them at all. They include an image that showcases what you are offering. They can be cheaper than other types of Spotify ads as well.</p><p>Usually, an overlay ad will be displayed at the top of the Spotify app. Whenever the user goes back to the Spotify interface, that’s when these ads will be displayed. Users can click on them and be led to wherever your landing destination is set online.</p><h3 id="Sponsored-List"><a href="#Sponsored-List" class="headerlink" title="Sponsored List"></a>Sponsored List</h3><p>Also known as Spotify Sponsored Playlists, they allow you to launch a brand awareness campaign on Spotify. You may create playlists of songs that best relate to your brand.

That’s when it will play your audio ad.</p><h3 id="Spotify-Video-Ads-1"><a href="#Spotify-Video-Ads-1" class="headerlink" title="Spotify Video Ads"></a>Spotify Video Ads</h3><p>Video ads on Spotify are 15 to 30-second clips that include audio and visuals to convey a message. They can be played on both Desktop and Mobile.</p><p>Spotify will display these ads when the user is actively engaged on the screen. However, it will not play them if their phone is locked and if Spotify is not active on the net.</p><p>There are two types of Spotify video ads you can use, namely video Takeover Ads and Spotify Sponsored Sessions.

They include an image that showcases what you are offering. They can be cheaper than other types of Spotify ads as well.</p><p>Usually, an overlay ad will be displayed at the top of the Spotify app. Whenever the user goes back to the Spotify interface, that’s when these ads will be displayed. Users can click on them and be led to wherever your landing destination is set online.</p><h3 id="Sponsored-List-1"><a href="#Sponsored-List-1" class="headerlink" title="Sponsored List"></a>Sponsored List</h3><p>Also known as Spotify Sponsored Playlists, they allow you to launch a brand awareness campaign on Spotify.

In case if you love <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >diving <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> then you must go for a waterproof device or one that can be protected with external housing. Those who are cycling enthusiasts may need to record everything on a go so it is good to pick a device that can be easily mounted on chest or <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >helmet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It must also offer stabilized video recording. Similarly, athletes can have so many requirements but the good news is that the latest cameras are also developed with all stunning features to provide satisfactory results.</p><p> The guide below will help you to get best details about device as well as accessories so that you can have perfect camera for your adventure sports activities.</p><h2 id="Complete-Buying-Guide"><a href="#Complete-Buying-Guide" class="headerlink" title="Complete Buying Guide"></a>Complete Buying Guide</h2><h4 id="1-Mounts"><a href="#1-Mounts" class="headerlink" title="1. Mounts"></a>1. Mounts</h4><p> If you are thinking to buy an action camera then you may probably need a support to hold it while shooting during adventurous activities. Action cameras are usually lighter in weight, smaller in size and have waterproof design but note that not all companies use to manufacture cameras with these specifications. For example the GoPro camera shapes are completely different from that of Sony cameras. It is not possible to use same mount for both these devices to adjust them on suction cup or on helmet.</p><p> You can easily find so many third party accessories for action cameras that are available at different price ranges in market but the quality also varies. Even a camera mount with same design and shape can vary by great amount in terms of its material quality and price range. If you are buying a costly action camera then we suggest you to go for branded accessories only as they add safety to usage. Do not spend on cheaper models rather search for a company that you trust and know well.</p><p><strong>1. Head and Hat Mounts:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/head-and-hat-mounts.jpg"                                     ></p><p> With few high quality cameras you will get head and hat mounts as additional accessories at the time of purchase but for few basic designs you may have to buy them separately. The general price range for mounts is above $10 and it varies as per your brand selection.</p><p><strong>2. Helmet Mounts:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/helmet-mouts.jpg"                      alt="helmet mouts"                ></p><p> This is one of the most commonly available types of mounts and is more popular among action camera lovers. These mounts can assist users to mount camera from side, front, top or back of helmet. Such mounts are also developed for making easy connections with vented helmets and smooth surfaced, with this facility you can easily run the straps through different vents. The price range of helmet mounts usually starts at $10 but it increases with increase in complexity.</p><p><strong>3. Chest Mounts:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chest-mounts.jpg"                      alt="chest mounts"                ></p><p> Generally people wish to avoid the shakes that helmet and head mounts usually offer so they go for Chest mounts. These mounts provide much better POV look and are specially recommended for skiing. Most of the top manufacturers like Sony, Contour and GoPro use to offer action camera mount at initial price range of $15.</p><p><strong>4. Wrist Mounts:</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wrist-mounts.jpg"                      alt="wrist mounts"                ></p><p> Wrist mounts are often preferred by divers but these days other users are also buying them. The price range for Wrist mounts starts from $15 and go much high with increasing quality.</p><p><strong>5. Motorcycle and Bicycle Mounts:</strong></p><p> Such type of mounts can be easily screwed with bike handles to have shaken proof recording. These mounts start from a price range of $10 but while using these mounts you need to keep in mind the road quality so that shakes can be avoided otherwise it may affect your footage.</p><h4 id="2-Power-Accessories-–-Buy-It"><a href="#2-Power-Accessories-–-Buy-It" class="headerlink" title="2. Power Accessories – Buy It"></a>2. Power Accessories – Buy It</h4><p> When you buy a branded action camera then it comes with a standard <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >battery unit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, few device uses to have removable battery whereas other have fixed battery unit inside. For users, it is necessary to have information about how long life their battery will have with 4K shooting or with 1080p level. If you are planning to film for the whole day then you may need additional batteries for replacement if possible.</p><p> Many third party sellers will offer you camera compatible <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >batteries <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at cheap price range but lots of risks are involved in that. Few of these can serve you perfectly for long hours but others may start heating up the whole device with time. Prefer to check user reviews before investing on such batteries.</p><h4 id="3-Fast-Memory-Card"><a href="#3-Fast-Memory-Card" class="headerlink" title="3. Fast Memory Card"></a>3. Fast Memory Card</h4><p> Most of professionals love to take several memory cards on their tour so that they can easily switch while shooting. If you have better stock then you will never face trouble if a card fails at the time of shooting. It is even good to carry a mixture of big and small cards but ensure that you have bought them from trustworthy companies and they will never harm your camera. Note that there are so many big and small companies in market that are selling memory cards in bulk but the quality may vary by great extent.</p><h4 id="4-Waterproof-Housing-–-Buy-It"><a href="#4-Waterproof-Housing-–-Buy-It" class="headerlink" title="4. Waterproof Housing – Buy It "></a>4. Waterproof Housing – Buy It <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/waterproof-housing.jpg"                                     ></h4><p> It is not necessary that your water resistant camera is waterproof too because few designs are not having such feature. If you need a waterproof camera then you may need additional waterproof housing for it. While buying such cameras you need to know that how deep it can go under water as few cameras are rated with underwater safety up to 60’ or others may have up to 30’. These waterproof designs also serve with great sand protection; whereas impact resistance is one more important element that you need to consider for protected camera design.</p><h4 id="5-Lights-–-Depends-on-You"><a href="#5-Lights-–-Depends-on-You" class="headerlink" title="5.

Most of these are camera specific whereas others possess special conversion type adapters that can be easily attached to other devices. While buying such lights you must get enough details about their usage, power and battery life. <strong>Intova</strong> manufacturers use to provide classic dive lights with a price tag of $40 and it can be used with one handed operation.</p><p><strong>Qudos</strong> have developed lights for GoPro action camera and its price is around $120 whereas overall weight uses to be less than 150 grams. This accessory use to be waterproof up to the depth of 40 meters under water so it is rated to be ideal for scuba divers. The best news for buyers is that Qudos action cam light is compatible with most of non GoPro cameras if you have a simple conversion mount. So if you are a first time buyer then it will be a great offer for you.</p><h4 id="6-Audio"><a href="#6-Audio" class="headerlink" title="6. Audio "></a>6. Audio <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/action-camera-microphone.jpg"                      alt="action camera microphone"                ></h4><p> Most of the action camera models use to have poor sound quality same as common video cameras but in order to avail great results it is necessary to buy additional audio recording mechanism. Such devices can easily sync even with low quality audio inputs or external mics so that you can have perfect recording on the go. It also supports classic recording with stereo microphones that are designed with omni-directional style. Few cameras provide perfect support to audio signals even with external housing and the footage is always with crystal clear voice. Such designs are really suitable if you wish to choose the live streaming option as you will be able to upload stunning videos without pre-processing.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like</strong>: <a class="link"   href="https://filmora.wondershare.com/action-camera/best-mics-for-action-cameras.html" >Best Microphones for Action Cameras 2017 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="7-Filters"><a href="#7-Filters" class="headerlink" title="7. Filters"></a>7. Filters</h4><p> Those who wish to shoot videos under water with perfect colour tone must choose a camera with advanced filter addition. When you are recording a shoot under water up to depth of 3 meters or 9 feet then it is sufficient to have better white balance. On the other side if you have to go below 9 feet then complete colour filters become essential. When you use filters then it is possible to have much better variations over foreground and background colours. These filters assist in improved colour distribution for recorded footage and produce a richer blue at background. This is definitely an important aesthetic when you are shooting under water.</p><h4 id="8-Remote-Controls-–-Unnecessary"><a href="#8-Remote-Controls-–-Unnecessary" class="headerlink" title="8.

But with the high cost (such as GoPro remote kit, which demands $79.99), we truly recommend you to use the mobile apps offered by the brands. Sony, Contour, and GoPro have mobile apps that allow you to control the camera and monitor the video. And most of the camera apps are free.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-pixel-powerhouse-expert-review-on-top-8k-tv-models/"><u>In 2024, Pixel Powerhouse  Expert Review on Top 8K TV Models</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-watermarking-masters-the-leading-tools-reviewed/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Watermarking Masters  The Leading Tools Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/professional-panoramas-and-cinematography-with-hero5-black/"><u>Professional Panoramas & Cinematography with Hero5 Black</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-25plus-best-practices-for-crafting-witty-metaverse-visual-jokes/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  25+ Best Practices for Crafting Witty Metaverse Visual Jokes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-your-sound-design-with-easy-transitions-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhancing Your Sound Design with Easy Transitions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-6-empowering-metaverse-instances-explained/"><u>2024 Approved  6 Empowering Metaverse Instances Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-unraveling-untethered-art-top-public-domain-gems-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unraveling Untethered Art  Top Public Domain Gems for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-gigglemaker-step-by-step-to-fun-videos/"><u>[New] In 2024, GiggleMaker  Step-by-Step to Fun Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-directory-of-public-domain-gaming-melodies/"><u>2024 Approved  Essential Directory of Public Domain Gaming Melodies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-unveiling-nikons-1j5-a-4k-video-masterpiece/"><u>In 2024, Unveiling Nikon's 1J5  A 4K Video Masterpiece</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/from-raw-footage-to-youtube-perfection-premiere-pro-techniques/"><u>From Raw Footage to YouTube Perfection - Premiere Pro Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-how-to-record-whatsapp-call/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  How to Record WhatsApp Call</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/the-way-to-get-back-lost-data-from-samsung-galaxy-a05s-by-fonelab-android-recover-data/"><u>The way to get back lost data from Samsung Galaxy A05s</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-essential-tiktok-analytics-for-account-growth/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Essential TikTok Analytics for Account Growth</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-sim-unlock-motorola-moto-g24-phones-without-code-2-ways-to-remove-android-sim-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Sim Unlock Motorola Moto G24 Phones without Code 2 Ways to Remove Android Sim Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-factory-reset-motorola-edge-2023-in-5-easy-ways-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>How to Factory Reset Motorola Edge 2023 in 5 Easy Ways | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-ways-on-how-to-unlockbypassswiperemove-xiaomi-14-pro-fingerprint-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Best Ways on How to Unlock/Bypass/Swipe/Remove Xiaomi 14 Pro Fingerprint Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/master-video-editing-on-mac-vn-video-editor-and-its-competitors-for-2024/"><u>Master Video Editing on Mac VN Video Editor and Its Competitors for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/in-2024-maximize-your-videos-the-top-10-free-4k-video-converter-software/"><u>In 2024, Maximize Your Videos The Top 10 Free 4K Video Converter Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-effortless-methods-for-capturing-google-voice-conversations/"><u>[New] Effortless Methods for Capturing Google Voice Conversations</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Filmmakers are now able to create wonders with cinematic, jaw dropping results that were earlier just impossible in Hollywood productions. But if you are new to this world of drone then you must be searching for some information regarding how to shoot aerial videos using drone to get professional results. If so, then don’t worry! Because the article below will provide you complete information about impressive filming techniques with latest drones.</p><p> Let’s check a video tutorial first:</p><h2 id="Tips-for-Filming-with-Drone"><a href="#Tips-for-Filming-with-Drone" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Filming with Drone"></a>Tips for Filming with Drone</h2><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Techniques</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Weather</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Camera</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Editing</a></li></ul><h3 id="Techniques"><a href="#Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Techniques"></a>Techniques</h3><p> In order to get best results with your aerial shoot, try these professional techniques:</p><h4 id="1-Go-Slow"><a href="#1-Go-Slow" class="headerlink" title="1.  Go Slow"></a>1.  Go Slow</h4><p> The very first recommendation to beginners from professionals is to move slowly. It leaves cinematic impression on viewers as your slow motion makes them think that you are shooting from a larger platform such as helicopter. No doubt, it will increase the production value and shots will appear perfectly crafted and well controlled.</p><p> Ensure that you operate RC control stick very smoothly. Take help from gradual movements so that undesired shakes in footage can be avoided and at the same time care about slow acceleration and deceleration to avoid distortion from end results.</p><p> It is good to pre-plan as well as visual most of your aerial shots. One should prefer to advance guard his filming location so that all pros and cons can be pre-observed and proper planning can be done to get rid of limitations of that area. If you know your requirements in advance and have an effective plan for the site then you will definitely be able to make most out of your limited battery life of drone. You will not feel happy if some shots are missed just because of mismanagement and drained drone battery.</p><h4 id="2-Two-Axis-type-Movement"><a href="#2-Two-Axis-type-Movement" class="headerlink" title="2.  Two Axis type Movement"></a>2.  Two Axis type Movement</h4><p> There are few hidden tricks behind those breathtaking shots of big budget movies and it is good to implement them with care. Most of those professionals prefer to implement two axis type movements simultaneously. They often make some arrangements to fly backwards as well as downwards at the same time but note that such movements must be controlled at much smoother rate with stable adjustments.</p><h4 id="3-Strafe"><a href="#3-Strafe" class="headerlink" title="3.  Strafe"></a>3.  Strafe</h4><p> When you have to focus on attractive landscapes then the best idea is to use sideways movements or the strafing feature. It will help you to show landscapes with different prospective and results will naturally be more impressive. Usually, most of the shots over landscapes in Hollywood movies are recorded with aerial motions where drone keep on moving forward and backward, so if you try the strafing effect then it will definitely be a unique and awesome idea. This recording style will also help you to reveal various eye catching features of the landscape.</p><h4 id="4-Orbit"><a href="#4-Orbit" class="headerlink" title="4.  Orbit"></a>4.  Orbit</h4><p> If you want to achieve Orbit then you have to control your drone strafe movements towards left or right side while pulling that yaw stick to exactly opposite direction. Let me make it clear that yaw stick is a control stick that you will find on left side of your drone controller and it is there to control rotation action of drone. Note that, you need to have more practice on that yaw control because most of users, even professionals end up spinning much faster and results are too bad.</p><h4 id="5-Fly-Through-Shots"><a href="#5-Fly-Through-Shots" class="headerlink" title="5.  Fly Through Shots"></a>5.  Fly Through Shots</h4><p> Here is something more cinematic but it is going to be risky enough. You need to be more careful to capture this type of shots because it demands you complete attention on controller screen for drone navigation. If you believe on your piloting skills then you will definitely achieve success in this recording action. When these shots are captured perfectly, they have power to capture attention of viewers and they will soon become fan of your cinematography skills along with your risk management strategy.</p><h3 id="Weather"><a href="#Weather" class="headerlink" title="Weather"></a>Weather</h3><p> When we talk about weather then it is something out of your control and you have just one option that is to pray mercy from Mother Nature. To capture some of the best shots you will often need to fly in a clean sky and you definitely don’t need that heavy fog and rain. This issue is more common in winter days, especially when you are working on high altitudes that get freeze due to cold.</p><p><strong>What to do?</strong></p><ul><li>The first most important trick is to avoid taking shots in windy day. Generally, most of the advanced drone units can bear the pressure of up to 25-35 mph wind but if it goes above this range then your footage will get spoiled. It is not a good idea to simply rely on post processing techniques like jello effect etc. However, few professionals are able to refine their shots with Wrap Stabilization Setting to get best results.</li><li>Choose golden hours of the day to shoot your footage. The time of sunset and sunrise will help your footage to stand out as shadows are highly visible during this time and it will naturally create a natural impact. People rarely shoot scenes at sunrise time so you can try to implement this trick to prove yourself different from those common aerial shooters.</li></ul><h3 id="Camera"><a href="#Camera" class="headerlink" title="Camera"></a>Camera</h3><p> Some of the most common camera settings that demand your focus are flat image profile and shutter speed.</p><ul><li>**Flat Image Profile:**There is no doubt to say that your camera settings are going to leave great impact on your footage so use them effectively. Prefer to work on flattest camera profile as it will help you to get impressive dynamic range with aerial camera. This technique of shooting helps users to prevent clouds and sky and also helps users to retain details from darkest point on ground.</li><li><strong>Control Shutter Speed:</strong><br> It is good to work with lower shutter speed and in order to avoid strobing effect one must prefer to shot by keeping camera close to ground. Keep it somewhere around 100th to 250th level of second, one can also work with ND filter to control shutter speed to desired lower level. In case if you work with 500th or 100th part of second then you will naturally obtain sharper frames with it leads to footage with heavy strobing.</li></ul><h3 id="Editing"><a href="#Editing" class="headerlink" title="Editing"></a>Editing</h3><p> If you need to edit your shots to get customized results then it is most important to choose a professional and high quality software tool. One of the best professional recommendations is <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> due to its intuitive interface and ability to edit 4k video shoots.

Play any video of your liking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-vimeo-watch.jpg"                      alt="play video vimeo watch"                ></p><p>Step 2: Now, you need to change the URL of the video you are playing. Here are the changes to make in the address bar.</p><ul><li>Remove everything at the beginning of “vimeo.com”. Add “.player” at the beginning of the URL.</li><li>Add “&#x2F;video&#x2F;“ after “vimeo.com”.</li><li>Add “?amp;loop&#x3D;1:” at the end of the URL.</li></ul><p>Therefore, the initial URL of the video was “<a class="link"   href="https://vimeo.com/754255543" >https://vimeo.com/754255543 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“.

Avoid using any names trademarked, copyrighted, or already in use by another show</h3><p>The main legal principles with podcasts are copyright, publicity rights, and trademark. Therefore, Avoiding using any trademarked, copyrighted, or already used by another company or podcast is crucial.</p><p>Searching Google for trademarks is the best way to discover whether your name idea has already been trademarked. Moreover, you can check for conflicts by applying for podcast name approval via the Apple Podcasts Connect portal. If you’re unsure what you want, research similar names before settling.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify"><a href="#Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2.

Make sure the name has not been used before on Apple Podcasts and Spotify</h3><p>It is easy to search for your show’s potential name in a podcast directory. However, if the same name is already used, it is time to create a variation or start over.</p><p>You cannot submit your podcast to Spotify if there is a show with the same title.

Avoid overly long podcast names or “keyword stuffing,” as iTunes&#x2F;Apple Podcasts are clamping down on this.</p><p>When the audience comes and visits your channel, the name of it matters the most as it’s the most obvious thing that meets the eyes. In this case, you must create a channel name that is true to your content and catchy so it hooks the audience from the start.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot"><a href="#Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4.

You should also be able to recognize your podcast name if you hear it in passing, and it should be easy to pronounce. You can practice saying your podcast name by completing the following sentences:</p><ul><li>“Hi, I’m the host of ___________.”</li><li>“Welcome to another episode of ___________.”</li><li>“You’ve got to listen to ___________!”</li></ul><p>Choose a name you like to say because you’ll be saying it.

It becomes an issue of legality and ethicality. If you create a channel with a name similar to another podcast, the original podcast channel will have a right to sue your channel.</p><p>In some rare cases, there have been podcasts with similar names, but usually, one of them will eventually go down.

But you can protect your channel by creating a podcast name that is unique in itself.</p><p>If you find accounts that pretend to be your channel, you can ask your audience to report such sources. Or the best course is legal action. But first, develop a trademark policy to help you give immunity against these channels.</p><p>So if in the future it gets to mislead your audience, they will be held accountable for legal action.</p><h3 id="4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast"><a href="#4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast" class="headerlink" title="4.

What factors should you take into consideration? And what are some of the common mistakes made by podcasters when it comes to naming their shows? So let’s dive into it.</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Avoid-using-any-names-trademarked-copyrighted-or-already-in-use-by-another-show-1"><a href="#Tip-1-Avoid-using-any-names-trademarked-copyrighted-or-already-in-use-by-another-show-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1. Avoid using any names trademarked, copyrighted, or already in use by another show"></a>Tip 1. Avoid using any names trademarked, copyrighted, or already in use by another show</h3><p>The main legal principles with podcasts are copyright, publicity rights, and trademark. Therefore, Avoiding using any trademarked, copyrighted, or already used by another company or podcast is crucial.</p><p>Searching Google for trademarks is the best way to discover whether your name idea has already been trademarked. Moreover, you can check for conflicts by applying for podcast name approval via the Apple Podcasts Connect portal. If you’re unsure what you want, research similar names before settling.</p><h3 id="Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify-1"><a href="#Tip-2-Make-sure-the-name-has-not-been-used-before-on-Apple-Podcasts-and-Spotify-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2. Make sure the name has not been used before on Apple Podcasts and Spotify"></a>Tip 2. Make sure the name has not been used before on Apple Podcasts and Spotify</h3><p>It is easy to search for your show’s potential name in a podcast directory. However, if the same name is already used, it is time to create a variation or start over.</p><p>You cannot submit your podcast to Spotify if there is a show with the same title. Doing your research will save you time and hassle.</p><h3 id="Tip-3-iTunes-Apple-Podcasts-Keywords-“Spam-”-1"><a href="#Tip-3-iTunes-Apple-Podcasts-Keywords-“Spam-”-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. iTunes &#x2F; Apple Podcasts &amp; Keywords “Spam.”"></a>Tip 3. iTunes &#x2F; Apple Podcasts &amp; Keywords “Spam.”</h3><p>Another goal in boosting or promoting your channel would be to make a channel name that is simple and easy to pronounce. Avoid overly long podcast names or “keyword stuffing,” as iTunes&#x2F;Apple Podcasts are clamping down on this.</p><p>When the audience comes and visits your channel, the name of it matters the most as it’s the most obvious thing that meets the eyes. In this case, you must create a channel name that is true to your content and catchy so it hooks the audience from the start.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot-1"><a href="#Tip-4-Try-to-say-your-podcast’s-name-out-loud-and-a-lot-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4. Try to say your podcast’s name out loud and a lot"></a>Tip 4. Try to say your podcast’s name out loud and a lot</h3><p>As a podcast is an audio medium, your name should be easy to pronounce. You should also be able to recognize your podcast name if you hear it in passing, and it should be easy to pronounce. You can practice saying your podcast name by completing the following sentences:</p><ul><li>“Hi, I’m the host of ___________.”</li><li>“Welcome to another episode of ___________.”</li><li>“You’ve got to listen to ___________!”</li></ul><p>Choose a name you like to say because you’ll be saying it. A lot.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Get-feedback-from-your-network-1"><a href="#Tip-5-Get-feedback-from-your-network-1" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5. Get feedback from your network"></a>Tip 5. Get feedback from your network</h3><p>Generating a name for a podcast is not an easy job. However, you can also get feedback from your network. For example, you are gathering suggestions from your friends or teammates. If your podcast has already got some followers, you can ask the audience for advice and let them comment below the podcast.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-Podcast-Name-Ideas-Generators-1"><a href="#Part-4-Hot-FAQs-on-Podcast-Name-Ideas-Generators-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Can 2 podcasts have the same name?"></a>1. Can 2 podcasts have the same name?</h3><p>The simple answer would be <strong>“No.”</strong> You cannot have a podcast whose name is similar to another. It becomes an issue of legality and ethicality. If you create a channel with a name similar to another podcast, the original podcast channel will have a right to sue your channel.</p><p>In some rare cases, there have been podcasts with similar names, but usually, one of them will eventually go down. It is all about originality.</p><h3 id="2-Should-I-name-my-podcast-my-name-1"><a href="#2-Should-I-name-my-podcast-my-name-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Should I name my podcast my name?"></a>2. Should I name my podcast my name?</h3><p>There’s nothing wrong with naming your podcast with your name as long as it is unique and stands out. You cannot simply name your podcast, i.e., “<strong>Joe Rogan</strong>.” Instead, your podcast can include your name creatively, such as, i.e., <strong>“The Joe Rogan Experience.”</strong></p><h3 id="3-Can-someone-steal-my-podcast-name-1"><a href="#3-Can-someone-steal-my-podcast-name-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Can someone steal my podcast name?"></a>3. Can someone steal my podcast name?</h3><p>If your podcast is in its early stages, you may encounter some accounts pretending to be your channel. Unfortunately, it is common in the industry as people tend to prey on the weak ones. But you can protect your channel by creating a podcast name that is unique in itself.</p><p>If you find accounts that pretend to be your channel, you can ask your audience to report such sources. Or the best course is legal action. But first, develop a trademark policy to help you give immunity against these channels.</p><p>So if in the future it gets to mislead your audience, they will be held accountable for legal action.</p><h3 id="4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast-1"><a href="#4-Should-I-rename-my-podcast-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Should I rename my podcast?"></a>4. Should I rename my podcast?</h3><p>You can do that in the early stages of your show’s growth. But as your audience grows, changing the channel’s name will only disturb your audience. They might think the original content creator was changed or the purpose of the show has been changed.</p><p>Keeping to your originality and creativity will set your channel in the light. Your goal should be to choose a Podcast name that is unique from the beginning and work on growing it to its</p><p>best potential.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-vr-cinematic-experiences-the-next-wave-for-2024/"><u>[New] VR Cinematic Experiences  The Next Wave for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-digital-glow-up-video-quality-boosting-tools-list/"><u>[New] Digital Glow-Up  Video Quality Boosting Tools List</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-optimal-focus-techniques-for-videoleap-users/"><u>In 2024, Optimal Focus Techniques for Videoleap Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-5-must-try-samsung-gear-vr-games/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  The 5 Must-Try Samsung Gear VR Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-envisioned-masterpieces-iphones-top-10-photographic-rules/"><u>In 2024, Envisioned Masterpieces  IPhone's Top 10 Photographic Rules</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-professional-editing-skills-using-gopro-studio-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unlock Professional Editing Skills Using GoPro Studio for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-huawei-p10-performance-metrics-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Huawei P10 Performance Metrics for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-practices-sourcing-background-beats-for-boxings/"><u>2024 Approved  Best Practices  Sourcing Background Beats for Boxings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-perfect-game-capture-in-minecraft/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Perfect Game Capture in Minecraft</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevate-your-yt-content-creation-with-windows-movie-maker/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Elevate Your YT Content Creation with Windows Movie Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/what-to-do-if-your-infinix-hot-30-5g-auto-does-not-work-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>What To Do if Your Infinix Hot 30 5G Auto Does Not Work | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-developers-dream-selecting-optimal-android-emulators-for-macpc/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Developer's Dream  Selecting Optimal Android Emulators for Mac/PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-tricks-to-upgrade-streaming-quality-on-mobile-apps-like-facebook-for-2024/"><u>[New] Tricks to Upgrade Streaming Quality on Mobile Apps Like Facebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-capture-sharp-clear-videos-on-your-mac-5-simple-techniques/"><u>[Updated] Capture Sharp, Clear Videos on Your Mac  5 Simple Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-exceptional-tiktok-pfp-creations-that-command-attention/"><u>[New] Exceptional TikTok PFP Creations that Command Attention</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The latest edition to the Windows family was rolled out on July 29th, and those who have been able to make the upgrade have had some pretty nice things to say about it. Time will ultimately tell if Windows 10 is really going to be a hit, but early indications point to that being the case.</p><p>If you’re still waiting for the go-ahead from Microsoft to download Windows 10 free, then you at least have some time to look at some of the Windows 10 features.</p><h4 id="1-Top-Windows-10-Features"><a href="#1-Top-Windows-10-Features" class="headerlink" title="1.

The improvements to Windows 10 are vast, when you compare them to Windows 8 or Windows 8.1. We all know by now just how unpopular Windows 8 and 8.1 were. Some people even decided to stick with Windows 7 instead.</p><p>Microsoft is clearly looking to bring the world at large on board with Windows 10. To that end, they have brought a number of exciting features to the table:</p><p><strong>Cortana Virtual Assistant</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/update-win10-13.png"                      alt="update win10 13"                ></p><p>Cortana is one of the biggest features Microsoft is rolling out for the Windows 10. If you have been using the Windows Phone, then you already have an idea of what to expect from the tablet&#x2F;PC version. This digital assistant is designed to be vastly superior to Siri or Google Now. You’ll find Cortana next to your desktop’s start button, but you can also say “Hey, Cortana” to bring it to life. You remain in complete control of how much Cortana knows about you, but you’ll definitely love the way Cortana can bring up requested information instantly. Early users have also noted that Cortana is more than capable of maintaining a full, almost-natural conversational flow.</p><p><strong>Edge Web Browser</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edge.jpg"                      alt="edge"                ></p><p>Say goodbye to Internet Explorer. The long-disliked browser is finally being chucked aside, in favor of something that will strive to be decidedly different. Although IE will still support legacy software, Edge is clearly the one taking center stage as the default browser for Windows 10. Features will include a screen grabbing tool that offers touchscreen sketching capabilities, a reading mode, and even a notepad. Search results will be built around your preferences, and you will have the ability as well to get restaurant information or directions shot to you in an instant.</p><p><strong>Windows 10 Start Menu</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/a8.png"                      alt="a8"                ></p><p>No one really liked the start menu layout for Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. Windows 10 offers a fantastic improvement to that end. If the start menu looks quite familiar, that’s because Microsoft has made it a point to bring back the style virtually all of us prefer. Yet Windows 10 will have some decided differences. The start menu will allow you to look over frequently-used apps, use the universal search without swiping, and yes, the tiles will be there, as well. However, you will be able to control how prominent they are.</p><p>These are just three of the new features of Windows 10. Ready to learn about a few more?</p><h4 id="2-More-Windows-10-Features"><a href="#2-More-Windows-10-Features" class="headerlink" title="2. More Windows 10 Features"></a>2. More Windows 10 Features</h4><p>The above three features are good examples of what Windows 10 will bring to the table, but that’s not it by a long shot:</p><p><strong>Xbox App and Streaming</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/windows10/xboy-games-windows10-1.png"                      alt="xbox games windows10"                ></p><p>Windows 10 will include an exciting Xbox app, which will come loaded with possibilities. The Xbox app will give you the ability to control your Xbox One, but you’ll also be able to utilize your DVR capture for your Windows games. Even more exciting is the way you’ll have the ability to play multiplayer titles across between your Xbox One and your PC. With the streaming side of things, Windows 10 will allow you to stream titles from your Xbox Box. There will also be DirectX 12 support.</p><p> <strong>Universal Apps</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/universal_apps.jpg"                      alt="universal_apps"                ></p><p>If you’re going to use Windows 10 across several different devices, you’re going to love this aspect. Photos, Music, Video, Map, People, and other apps will be available across all your devices. Furthermore, Windows 10 will ensure that your apps will look and function the same, regardless of the app you’re using.</p><p> <strong>Design and Interface Improvements</strong></p><p>There is a cohesiveness and consistency to everything that is going to make Windows 10 a highly pleasant experience for most of the people who use it. You’ll find that in terms of design and user interface, Windows 10 is a combination of modern features, the few good things about Windows 8 and Windows 8.1., and elements from past editions that we never wanted to get rid of.</p><h4 id="3-Get-Ready-For-Windows-10"><a href="#3-Get-Ready-For-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="3.Get Ready For Windows 10"></a>3.Get Ready For Windows 10</h4><p>Some people are already enjoying Windows 10.

Both of these are compared in detail as below:</p><h4 id="1-Hardware"><a href="#1-Hardware" class="headerlink" title="1.Hardware"></a>1.Hardware</h4><p><strong>Touch Screen:</strong> When displays of both these cameras are compared then it was observed that YI 4K provides better response as compared to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro Hero5 Black <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Size of display is also larger in case of YI 4K as it goes up to 2.19” whereas Hero5 has 2” screen. The Touch Screen is found more interactive in YI 4K whereas in case of Hero5 you may need to press twice especially when it is wet. The front LCD display of GoPro provides additional settings menu for easy control.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/yi-4k-touchscreen.jpg"                      alt="Yi 4K action camera touchscreen"                ></p><p> Image source:elproducente.com</p><p><strong>Waterproof:</strong> The biggest benefit of GoPro Hero5 is that it can serve you underwater but YI 4K cannot as you need additional protective case for this camera. But you cannot save your recordings from handling noise in case of GoPro unit. When you go underwater with YI 4K while using protective housing then it is not possible to use its touch screen feature and secondly the audio quality decays by large extent.</p><p><strong>Battery Life:</strong> Both of these camera units come with removable batteries but in case of Hero5 you can enjoy recording only up to 1hr 40 minutes with its 1220mAh battery backup whereas the YI 4K camera is developed with 1400mAh battery that can serve perfectly for 2 hours. Prefer to use these cameras with WiFi connections turned off in order to save battery for longer duration.</p><h4 id="2-Performance"><a href="#2-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.Performance"></a>2.Performance</h4><p><strong>Image Resolution:</strong> Photo quality of both cameras is 12MP and digital image stabilization feature is added to both units. You can find much warmer and smoother quality with Yi 4K whereas GoPro offers services for RAW photography.</p><p><strong>Video Resolution:</strong> When we talk about the video resolution then different ratings must be compared to get better idea about performance. When we talk about Go Pro Hero5 then maximum video quality is offered to be 4K at 30fps, 2.7k at 60fps, 1080p with 120fps and 720p at 240fps. On the other side in case of Xiaomi YI 4K you will be able to avail 4K at 30fps, 2.5K at 30fps, 1440p with 60fps, 1080p for 120fps and 720p with 200fps only.</p><p><strong>Audio Quality:</strong> Audio Quality of GoPro Hero5 is rated to be much superior as compared to Yi 4K camera unit. The housing helps to protect Hero5 from wind noise but it can perform even better without housing as compared to Yi 4K. Hero5 Black comes with 3 microphones and it helps to make better selection for audio streams.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> GoPro Hero5 can be ordered online with a payment of $399 but you will be glad to know that equally featured Xiaomi Yi Action Camera is cheaper as well as affordable with a price tag of $199.99 only. When we compare specs and hardware of both these cameras then Yi 4K is observed to provide all desired high performance results while meeting all needs of sports persons so you can think of buying Xiaomi product that falls in your budget.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p> Almost all features are discussed above and it is observed that if you are searching for a camera to record videos underwater or in rainy seasons then it is best idea to invest on GoPro Hero5 but in case of other adventurous sports activities Yi 4K can also provide you impressive results and it is a fit to budget camera unit. The Video and Photo quality is almost similar for both units but the battery backup of Yi 4K is again better then GoPro unit. So it is better to decide your budget and needs first and then pick the right camera unit for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unveiling-top-7-crypto-creators-for-nft-conversion/"><u>2024 Approved  Unveiling Top 7 Crypto-Creators for NFT Conversion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-zerocomplicationlivecast-your-simple-pathway-to-livestreaming-a-podcast-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] ZeroComplicationLivecast  Your Simple Pathway to Livestreaming a Podcast for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-premium-fourteen-high-res-full-frame-selection/"><u>2024 Approved  Premium Fourteen  High Res Full Frame Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-sidestep-personalized-podcast-suggestions-in-spotify/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Sidestep Personalized Podcast Suggestions in Spotify</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-action-seekers-guide-to-polaroid-xs-100i/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Action Seeker's Guide to Polaroid XS 100I</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-imagery-capturing-drones-in-10-selection/"><u>2024 Approved  Best Imagery-Capturing Drones in #10 Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-original-design-potential-utilize-free-logo-templates-and-customization-tools/"><u>[New] Original Design Potential  Utilize FREE Logo Templates & Customization Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-straightforward-guide-to-photo-uploads-on-instagram/"><u>In 2024, The Straightforward Guide to Photo Uploads on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-the-art-of-greenscreen-in-kinemaster/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Mastering the Art of Greenscreen in KineMaster</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-periscope-broadcasts-setting-up-for-success/"><u>2024 Approved  Periscope Broadcasts  Setting Up for Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-vimeos-global-distribution-guide/"><u>In 2024, Vimeo's Global Distribution Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-sim-unlock-nokia-c22-phones-without-code-2-ways-to-remove-android-sim-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Sim Unlock Nokia C22 Phones without Code 2 Ways to Remove Android Sim Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/metaverse-mayhem-top-party-games-listed/"><u>Metaverse Mayhem  Top Party Games Listed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-sculpting-images-a-beginners-guide-to-pics-distortion/"><u>[Updated] Sculpting Images  A Beginner's Guide to Pics Distortion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-guide-to-premium-free-online-screen-recorders/"><u>2024 Approved  Guide to Premium Free Online Screen Recorders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-reset-a-realme-12-5g-phone-that-is-locked-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Reset a Realme 12 5G Phone that is Locked?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/guide-to-streamlined-subscription-links-for-video-channels-for-2024/"><u>Guide to Streamlined Subscription Links for Video Channels for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sound-tweaking.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-art-of-acoustic-purification-guide-to-removing-audio-distractions-with-adobe-audition/"><u>2024 Approved The Art of Acoustic Purification Guide to Removing Audio Distractions with Adobe Audition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/new-transitioning-from-rgb-to-srgb/"><u>[New] Transitioning From Rgb to Srgb</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/he-top-beauty-brands-with-powerful-youtubers-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Top Beauty Brands with Powerful YouTubers for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>
