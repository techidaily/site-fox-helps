One of the main reasons users find it so useful is the ability to customize the video editing process by adding different kinds of plugins to the program. If you are looking to add unique and fancy text to the video you are working on, then these text plugins for After Effects will come in handy.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="TextDelay"><a href="#TextDelay" class="headerlink" title="TextDelay"></a>TextDelay</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Ftextdelay/" >https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Ftextdelay/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>TextDelay is a native plugin, meaning that you will find it already installed on After Effects. As the name suggests, you can use TextDelay to delay any other text transformations that you may add to the text and it allows you to delay these transformations by word, line, or even character. It comes with a range selector that allows you to have precise control over which characters can get the effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-delay-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text delay plugin"                ></p><h2 id="TextExploder"><a href="#TextExploder" class="headerlink" title="TextExploder"></a>TextExploder</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/textexploder/" >https://aescripts.com/textexploder/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>TextExploder is an After Effects plugin that is developed by MamoWorld and it allows you to split the text layers in After Effects into words, lines, characters, and more. These splits are so powerful that you can very easily isolate a single word or even a single letter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-exploder-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text exploder plugin"                ></p><h2 id="iExpressions-2"><a href="#iExpressions-2" class="headerlink" title="iExpressions 2"></a>iExpressions 2</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/iexpressions/" >https://aescripts.com/iexpressions/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you want to effectively use the After Effects expressions even if you are not familiar with coding, iExpressions 2 is the text plugin to consider. It comes with 22 ready-to-use iExpressions that you can easily customize to fit into your project and it is so easy to use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/iexpression-2-plugin.jpg"                      alt="iexpression 2 plugin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123477/16836" target="_top" id="2123477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123477/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="TextBox"><a href="#TextBox" class="headerlink" title="TextBox"></a>TextBox</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/textbox/" >https://aescripts.com/textbox/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>If you want to create the perfect shape behind your text, then TextBox is a good text plugin to consider. This is a native After Effects plugin, meaning that you will not need to install it and the shapes it creates can be very easily customized. It updates the shapes you create automatically and adds them to the text layer, making it the most ideal solution to create closed captions, lower thirds, and subtitles.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/text-box-plugin.jpg"                      alt="text box plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Font-Manager"><a href="#Font-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Font Manager"></a>Font Manager</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aescripts.com/font-manager/" >https://aescripts.com/font-manager/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Font Manager is an After Effects text plugin that is useful when creating and working with animated typefaces. You can use it to create the most complex animated text graphics in just a few simple clicks. You will also find it very familiar to use as the user interface is similar to the Character Panel in After Effects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/font-manager-plugin.jpg"                      alt="font manager plugin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1899850">                    <video width="486" height="864" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1899850.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1899850">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1899850.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:304px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Felectronicx.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1899850%2F14483'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1899850/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Cartoon-Moblur"><a href="#Cartoon-Moblur" class="headerlink" title="Cartoon Moblur"></a>Cartoon Moblur</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Fcartoon%5Fmoblur" >https://www.toolfarm.com/buy/plugin%5Feverything%5Fcartoon%5Fmoblur <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This is the most ideal plugin to choose when you want to add motion trail to the graphics in your video, but you want them to appear very cartoony. If you have used the motion blur effect in After Effects, Cartoon Moblur will behave in a similar function, but it is more suited to 2D, flat or minimal graphics. Some of the factors that you can customize include the length of the blur (shutter angle), color, and opacity.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/cartoon-moblur-plugin.jpg"                      alt="cartoon moblur plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Shadow-Studio"><a href="#Shadow-Studio" class="headerlink" title="Shadow Studio"></a>Shadow Studio</h2><p>If you are looking for shadow styles that will go very well with your project, Shadow Studio is a good plugin to get. It offers you a wide variety of shadow styles including radial, inner, soft, and long shadows. Most people find it an easier and more affordable way to add soft shadows as compared to traditional methods like raytracing. It is also quite easy to use, meaning that shadow effects that would take hours to complete can be done in a matter of minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/shadow-studio-plugin.jpg"                      alt="shadow studio plugin"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123748/7443" target="_top" id="2123748">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123748" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123748/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115937/19272" target="_top" id="2115937">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115937" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115937/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Texts-Animation-Bundle"><a href="#Texts-Animation-Bundle" class="headerlink" title="Texts Animation Bundle"></a>Texts Animation Bundle</h2><p>Link: <a class="link"   href="https://aedownload.com/download-texts-animation-bundle-free-videohive/" >https://aedownload.com/download-texts-animation-bundle-free-videohive/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>This is a bundle of more than 80 different templates to add text effects to any text in After Effects. All the templates in the bundle are easily customizable and the plugin is very easy to use, allowing you to create amazing text effects in just a few clicks.

The horizontal side of a 4K video has approximately 4000 pixels, while in most cases, 4K videos displayed on monitors and TVs have a resolution of 3840X2160 pixels. The movie industry standard is 4096x2160 pixels.</p><p>Ultimately, the 4K video’s resolution depends on its aspect ratio, as slight variations occur with either of the most commonly used aspect ratios for 4K videos. This, however, doesn’t affect the image quality.</p><h3 id="2-How-to-play-a-4K-video-on-a-PC"><a href="#2-How-to-play-a-4K-video-on-a-PC" class="headerlink" title="2.

So, once you’ve installed a media player that can play 4K videos, you just have to open the video file with the media player of your choice.</p><p>In addition, you are going to need a 4K display to view the video in full resolution because HD or Full HD displays can’t play 4K footage in full detail.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118326/7443" target="_top" id="2118326">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118326" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118326/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Do-you-need-a-special-media-player-for-4K-videos"><a href="#3-Do-you-need-a-special-media-player-for-4K-videos" class="headerlink" title="3.

Consequently, the amount of details a 4K video can depict is much more significant than on 1080p videos. That is also the reason why 4K video files are much larger than Full HD video files that contain significantly fewer pixels.</p><p>However, it is nearly impossible to spot a difference between a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >1080p video and 4K video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from afar, but as you zoom in, you will notice that pixelization occurs at different zoom levels.</p><h3 id="5-Is-the-4K-video-available-on-YouTube"><a href="#5-Is-the-4K-video-available-on-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="5.

But it’s actually quite helpful to understand when, and how to include voiceovers and narrations in your video project.</p><p>And when you learn how to use this technique the right way, your YouTube videos will become more engaging and your watch time will shoot up.</p><p>I’ll be demonstrating how to add voiceovers and narrations in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to help you step up your video creation game.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Voiceover-or-Narration"><a href="#Voiceover-or-Narration" class="headerlink" title="Voiceover or Narration?"></a>Voiceover or Narration?</h2><p>But first, what’s the difference between a voiceover and a narration? Truth be told, there is quite a bit of overlap between the two.</p><p>Typically, a voiceover is a technique used to impart some new information in a concise way, but narration generally conveys a storytelling aspect.</p><p>A voiceover is when the subject speaks but the screen has cut away from the person on screen. So the dialog is from a clear speaker, but the visuals have cut away to b-roll or other visual elements like a title slide.</p><p>On the other hand, a narration could be a different character speaking or an independent narrator as you would find in a novel.</p><p>From the layperson’s perspective, there is not much difference. In both situations, you are adding an audio-only track to your video project timeline.</p><p>The difference is more in terms of HOW you have chosen to tell your story on screen. It’s more of a stylistic distinction than anything else.</p><p>For the purpose of this article, I will be using the term “voiceover and “narration” interchangeably since they are both done the same way.</p><p>But here’s the good news: the way you add either option is the same in Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-01.png"                      alt="add either option"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-add-narration"><a href="#How-to-add-narration" class="headerlink" title="How to add narration"></a>How to add narration</h2><p>So the easiest way to add narration is directly to a project. The benefit of this is that you can record your narration inside Filmora while you watch the preview of your edited video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/stt-tts-srt-09.png"                      alt="add narration to project"                ></p><p>A good example of this would be narrating a story on top of some still images and video clips from a recent vacation. (In most cases you would want to turn off the sound of the video clip, or at least use ducking to help the viewer focus on the narration.)</p><p>You put the playhead where you want to start recording and hit the microphone icon under the preview window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/stt-tts-srt-08.png"                      alt="hit microphone icon"                ></p><p>A 3-second countdown will pop up and start recording immediately after this countdown.</p><p>You can record your narration and click stop.</p><p>After recording, you can trim and edit your narration, you can delete it and record it again, and can move it and edit it like any other feature.</p><h2 id="Some-Tips-for-Recording-Narration"><a href="#Some-Tips-for-Recording-Narration" class="headerlink" title="Some Tips for Recording Narration"></a>Some Tips for Recording Narration</h2><p>Try playing the clip in the preview window to get a sense of what you want to say fits well with the space available in the project.</p><p>Know what you want to tell your viewer rather than speak aimlessly. What can you do if your narration is too long?</p><p>You can edit pauses or weak parts out of the voiceover to trim it up. But if it is still too long, you can easily add another video clip, or even still images to help boost the length to match your narration.</p><p>Fortunately, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes equipped with video b-roll which is another great option. When using b-roll, it’s better to use multiple shorter clips than one longer clip in most cases. But adding the same b-roll clip near the beginning and another section of the same b-roll clip, later on, should help you match the length of your narration to the video timeline.</p><h2 id="Narration-is-a-great-storytelling-device"><a href="#Narration-is-a-great-storytelling-device" class="headerlink" title="Narration is a great storytelling device"></a>Narration is a great storytelling device</h2><p>Narration is a fantastic tool to have in your arsenal as a young filmmaker. It allows you to quickly communicate feelings, backstory, and context quickly and effectively.</p><p>Practice adding it to your videos to see how it adds depth and dimension to your videos.</p><p>It can also help make a connection with your audience because you can be relating to the images on the screen as they watch them. This is effective in building your YouTube audience.</p><h2 id="Always-use-a-good-mic"><a href="#Always-use-a-good-mic" class="headerlink" title="Always use a good mic"></a>Always use a good mic</h2><p>When adding voiceover or narration to your project, be sure to use a good USB microphone.

So the next time you record a video, think about how you could augment your video project with narration.</p><p>You might feel a little odd recording a voiceover for the first time, but it allows you to communicate a lot of information quickly and clarify what might overwise be obscure – and good video is all about communicating your POV clearly and with brevity.</p><p>Filmora makes it easy to add narration of voice-overs to your video projects.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Transforming-Your-Shots-with-Ease-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Transforming-Your-Shots-with-Ease-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Transforming Your Shots with Ease in Photoshop"></a>Transforming Your Shots with Ease in Photoshop</h2><p>In this Photoshop tutorial, we’re going to carve an image using four simple steps. Curving an image can be a great way to add some extra visual interest and dimension, and it’s a technique that can be used with a wide range of images. So, let’s get started!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/curve-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="curve image photoshop"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Simple-Steps-to-Curve-an-Image-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop"></a>Simple Steps to Curve an Image in Photoshop</h2><h5 id="Step1Create-a-New-Document"><a href="#Step1Create-a-New-Document" class="headerlink" title="Step1Create a New Document"></a>Step1Create a New Document</h5><p>To keep things simple, let’s start with a white canvas. Let’s open a new document now by going to File in the menu bar and tapping New. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+N or Command+N on your keyboard to generate a new document. Choose a size and orientation that is appropriate for your image.</p><h5 id="Step2Place-the-Image"><a href="#Step2Place-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step2Place the Image"></a>Step2Place the Image</h5><p>After creating the new document, open the image that you want to curve. You may do so by going to File &gt; Open in the menu bar or pressing Ctrl+O or Command+O on your keyboard. Once the image is open, go to Edit in the menu bar and select Place Embedded from the drop-down menu that appears. Select your image and click Place. The image will be placed on the canvas. If the document’s size does not match that of the image, you will see a transformation box surrounding the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/place-image-in-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="place image in photoshop"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Warp-the-Image"><a href="#Step3Warp-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step3Warp the Image"></a>Step3Warp the Image</h5><p>Now we’ll curve the image using the Warp Tool. Select the Warp Tool by clicking and holding on the Transform Tool in the toolbar. The Warp Tool is located at the bottom of the Transform Tool’s fly-out menu. Alternatively, you may press Ctrl+T or Command+T on your keyboard to open the Transform Tool’s fly-out menu and then select the Warp Tool from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/wrap-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="wrap image photoshop"                ></p><p>With the Warp Tool selected, hover your cursor over the image. You’ll see a grid appear over the image. Click and drag one of the middle nodes in the horizontal direction to begin curving the image. As you drag, you’ll see the image curve along with your cursor. If you want to increase or decrease the amount of curvature, simply press and hold the Shift key while dragging the node.</p><p>Play around with the settings in the options bar. There are quite a few different looks you can achieve just by adjusting these.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/change-image-height-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="change image height photoshop"                ></p><p>20% <strong>Horizontal Distortion</strong> makes one side of the image appear larger than the other.

Here’s -20% in the <strong>Bend</strong> box with a vertical bend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/flip-effect-image-photoshop.jpg"                      alt="flip effect image photoshop"                ></p><h5 id="Step4Save-the-Image"><a href="#Step4Save-the-Image" class="headerlink" title="Step4Save the Image"></a>Step4Save the Image</h5><p>Once you’re happy with the way your image looks, go to File &gt; Save As in the menu bar or press Ctrl+Shift+S or Command+Shift+S on your keyboard. Choose a file format and location to save your image and click Save. And that’s it!

Special Editions and Bonus Features</strong></p><p>As the VHS market grew, movie distributors released special editions and collector’s versions. These releases often included bonus features like behind-the-scenes footage and more. It also included interviews, the making of the movie, and deleted scenes.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Crafting-Compelling-Media-with-Narrative-Overlays"><a href="#Crafting-Compelling-Media-with-Narrative-Overlays" class="headerlink" title="Crafting Compelling Media with Narrative Overlays"></a>Crafting Compelling Media with Narrative Overlays</h2><p>Ah, the infamous voiceover. Some filmmakers hate it – considering it a lazy method of telling a story. But it’s actually quite helpful to understand when, and how to include voiceovers and narrations in your video project.</p><p>And when you learn how to use this technique the right way, your YouTube videos will become more engaging and your watch time will shoot up.</p><p>I’ll be demonstrating how to add voiceovers and narrations in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to help you step up your video creation game.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Voiceover-or-Narration"><a href="#Voiceover-or-Narration" class="headerlink" title="Voiceover or Narration?"></a>Voiceover or Narration?</h2><p>But first, what’s the difference between a voiceover and a narration? Truth be told, there is quite a bit of overlap between the two.</p><p>Typically, a voiceover is a technique used to impart some new information in a concise way, but narration generally conveys a storytelling aspect.</p><p>A voiceover is when the subject speaks but the screen has cut away from the person on screen. So the dialog is from a clear speaker, but the visuals have cut away to b-roll or other visual elements like a title slide.</p><p>On the other hand, a narration could be a different character speaking or an independent narrator as you would find in a novel.</p><p>From the layperson’s perspective, there is not much difference. In both situations, you are adding an audio-only track to your video project timeline.</p><p>The difference is more in terms of HOW you have chosen to tell your story on screen. It’s more of a stylistic distinction than anything else.</p><p>For the purpose of this article, I will be using the term “voiceover and “narration” interchangeably since they are both done the same way.</p><p>But here’s the good news: the way you add either option is the same in Filmora.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/get-started-with-filmora-01.png"                      alt="add either option"                ></p><h2 id="How-to-add-narration"><a href="#How-to-add-narration" class="headerlink" title="How to add narration"></a>How to add narration</h2><p>So the easiest way to add narration is directly to a project. The benefit of this is that you can record your narration inside Filmora while you watch the preview of your edited video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/stt-tts-srt-09.png"                      alt="add narration to project"                ></p><p>A good example of this would be narrating a story on top of some still images and video clips from a recent vacation. (In most cases you would want to turn off the sound of the video clip, or at least use ducking to help the viewer focus on the narration.)</p><p>You put the playhead where you want to start recording and hit the microphone icon under the preview window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/stt-tts-srt-08.png"                      alt="hit microphone icon"                ></p><p>A 3-second countdown will pop up and start recording immediately after this countdown.</p><p>You can record your narration and click stop.</p><p>After recording, you can trim and edit your narration, you can delete it and record it again, and can move it and edit it like any other feature.</p><h2 id="Some-Tips-for-Recording-Narration"><a href="#Some-Tips-for-Recording-Narration" class="headerlink" title="Some Tips for Recording Narration"></a>Some Tips for Recording Narration</h2><p>Try playing the clip in the preview window to get a sense of what you want to say fits well with the space available in the project.</p><p>Know what you want to tell your viewer rather than speak aimlessly. What can you do if your narration is too long?</p><p>You can edit pauses or weak parts out of the voiceover to trim it up. But if it is still too long, you can easily add another video clip, or even still images to help boost the length to match your narration.</p><p>Fortunately, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> comes equipped with video b-roll which is another great option. When using b-roll, it’s better to use multiple shorter clips than one longer clip in most cases. But adding the same b-roll clip near the beginning and another section of the same b-roll clip, later on, should help you match the length of your narration to the video timeline.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139119/17108" target="_top" id="2139119">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139119" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139119/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Narration-is-a-great-storytelling-device"><a href="#Narration-is-a-great-storytelling-device" class="headerlink" title="Narration is a great storytelling device"></a>Narration is a great storytelling device</h2><p>Narration is a fantastic tool to have in your arsenal as a young filmmaker. It allows you to quickly communicate feelings, backstory, and context quickly and effectively.</p><p>Practice adding it to your videos to see how it adds depth and dimension to your videos.</p><p>It can also help make a connection with your audience because you can be relating to the images on the screen as they watch them. This is effective in building your YouTube audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115936/19272" target="_top" id="2115936">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115936" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115936/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Always-use-a-good-mic"><a href="#Always-use-a-good-mic" class="headerlink" title="Always use a good mic"></a>Always use a good mic</h2><p>When adding voiceover or narration to your project, be sure to use a good USB microphone. A good quality sound will elevate your entire project and just requires a little planning.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/use-good-microphone.jpg"                      alt="use good microphone"                ></p><p>Also, be sure to check that your external microphone is selected when you start recording. There’s nothing worse than nailing the perfect narration and realizing it was recorded with the built-in mic, not your USB microphone.</p><h2 id="Should-you-use-narration-in-your-next-project"><a href="#Should-you-use-narration-in-your-next-project" class="headerlink" title="Should you use narration in your next project?"></a>Should you use narration in your next project?</h2><p>The best way to learn something is by doing it. So the next time you record a video, think about how you could augment your video project with narration.</p><p>You might feel a little odd recording a voiceover for the first time, but it allows you to communicate a lot of information quickly and clarify what might overwise be obscure – and good video is all about communicating your POV clearly and with brevity.</p><p>Filmora makes it easy to add narration of voice-overs to your video projects.

There are a few advanced features that require switching to <strong>AndroVid Pro App</strong>. However, it’s overall an easy-to-use app with not many ads in the free version too.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Advantages</strong></th><th><strong>Disadvantages</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>User-Friendly Interface</td><td>Some features only available in AndroVid Pro</td></tr><tr><td>All essential editing tools</td><td>Watermark</td></tr><tr><td>Remove Watermark by watching ads (some cases only)</td><td>7 Days free trial only</td></tr></tbody></table><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-AndroVid-App"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-AndroVid-App" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is AndroVid App?"></a>Part 1. What is AndroVid App?</h2><p>It is one of the best apps available to edit videos easily on Android more quickly and conveniently. It contains a wide range of basic video editing and enhancing features. There are two versions of the AndroVid App, a free one and a paid one known as AndroVid Pro.</p><p><strong>Download:</strong> You can download <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androvid&hl=en&gl=US" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from Google Play.</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> As discussed before, you can use AndroVid for free. There aren’t many limitations in the features, almost all the components are available in the free version, but there are ads. When it comes to Watermark, there is one in the free version. You must purchase the AndroVid Pro monthly or yearly subscriptions to remove it. Some simple tools, such as merge, covert, compress, etc., do not have a watermark, though. AndroVid doesn’t have any premium plugins either, but it does include an online asset shop for music, fonts, and other items that you can access more of by upgrading to Pro.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Key-features-of-AndroVid-Video-Editor-Maker"><a href="#Part-2-Key-features-of-AndroVid-Video-Editor-Maker" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

It’s much easier to draw shapes on video using this tool. Moreover, you can adjust the brush size, transparency, and colors.
